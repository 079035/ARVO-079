Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that could be patched in this diff file is the missing inclusion of header files for three source files in the `HB_SUBSET_sources` list: `hb-subset.hh`, `hb-subset-glyf.hh`, and `hb-subset-plan.hh`.

Summary of the fix:
The fix includes adding the missing header file inclusions for the three source files mentioned above in the `HB_SUBSET_sources` list.

Detailed description of the fix:
The fix involves modifying the `Makefile.sources` file. In the diff, three lines have been added to include the missing header files for the source files `hb-subset.hh`, `hb-subset-glyf.hh`, and `hb-subset-plan.hh` in the `HB_SUBSET_sources` list. This ensures that the necessary header files are included when building the code, preventing any potential issues due to missing declarations or definitions.
