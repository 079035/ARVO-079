1. Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in this case is not a security vulnerability but rather a build system vulnerability. The build system was not correctly including all necessary source files for the `libharfbuzz-subset` library, which could lead to incomplete or incorrect builds.

2. Short Summary of the Fix:
The fix for this issue was to include the missing source files in the `Makefile.sources` file. This ensures that all necessary files are included when building the `libharfbuzz-subset` library.

3. Detailed Description of the Fix:
The fix involved modifying the `Makefile.sources` file to include the missing source files for the `libharfbuzz-subset` library. Specifically, the `hb-subset.hh`, `hb-subset-glyf.hh`, and `hb-subset-plan.hh` files were added to the `HB_SUBSET_sources` variable. This variable is used by the build system to determine which source files to include when building the `libharfbuzz-subset` library. By adding these files to the `HB_SUBSET_sources` variable, the build system will now correctly include them in the build process.
