Vulnerability:
It appears that the vulnerability being patched in this diff file is related to the inclusion of new header files (`hb-subset.hh`, `hb-subset-glyf.hh`, `hb-subset-plan.hh`) in the `src/Makefile.sources` file.

Summary of the fix:
The fix involves adding the new header files (`hb-subset.hh`, `hb-subset-glyf.hh`, `hb-subset-plan.hh`) to the list of sources for the `libharfbuzz-subset` library in the `src/Makefile.sources` file.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The fix begins with the modified lines in the `src/Makefile.sources` file. 
2. The new header file `hb-subset.hh` is added on line 210.
3. The new header file `hb-subset-glyf.hh` is added on line 211.
4. The new header file `hb-subset-plan.hh` is added on line 212.
5. These additional header files are added to the list of sources for the `libharfbuzz-subset` library.
6. The fix ensures that the new header files are included in the build process, allowing them to be utilized by the `libharfbuzz-subset` library.
