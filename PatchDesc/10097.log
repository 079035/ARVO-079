Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that was fixed in this diff file is the absence of the header files "hb-subset.hh", "hb-subset-glyf.hh", and "hb-subset-plan.hh" in the Makefile.sources file. These header files were necessary for the proper compilation and linking of the code.

Summary of the fix:
The fix added the missing header files "hb-subset.hh", "hb-subset-glyf.hh", and "hb-subset-plan.hh" in the Makefile.sources file. This ensures that the code will compile correctly and avoid any potential compilation issues.

Detailed description of the fix:
The fix involves modifying the Makefile.sources file to include the missing header files. The added lines `hb-subset.hh`, `hb-subset-glyf.hh`, and `hb-subset-plan.hh` were added to the list of HB_SUBSET_sources. This change ensures that these header files are included in the compilation process, allowing the code to be compiled and linked properly. By adding these header files, any dependencies that these header files have on other code files will also be resolved, ensuring the code can be compiled successfully.
