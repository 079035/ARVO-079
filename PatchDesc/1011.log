Vulnerability:
The vulnerability patched in this diff file is a memory leak issue. If the `xmlAddChild` function fails to add a new `CData` node as a child of the given node, the newly created `CData` node is not being freed, causing a memory leak.

Short summary of the fix:
The fix ensures that if the `xmlAddChild` function fails to add a new `CData` node as a child of the given node, the newly created `CData` node is freed using the `xmlFreeNode` function.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the original code, after creating a new `CData` block using `xmlNewCDataBlock`, the code attempts to add it as a child using `xmlAddChild(ctxt->node, ret)`. However, if the `xmlAddChild` function fails to add the new node, there is no cleanup mechanism for the newly created `CData` node, resulting in a memory leak.

To fix this issue, the code has been modified. After calling `xmlAddChild`, the return value of `xmlAddChild` is checked against `NULL`, indicating if the adding was successful. If the return value is `NULL`, it means that the `CData` node was not added, and therefore the node is freed using `xmlFreeNode(ret)`.

This fix prevents memory leaks by ensuring that if the addition of the `CData` node fails, the node is properly freed before the function returns.
