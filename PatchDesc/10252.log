Vulnerability:
The vulnerability addressed by this patch is related to the incorrect initialization of the cur_sb_col variable in the loop restoration multi-threading of the AV1 video codec. When luma loop restoration is disabled, the initialization of cur_sb_col is not happening correctly, leading to potential issues in the code.

Summary of fix:
The patch fixes the vulnerability by ensuring that the initialization of cur_sb_col in lr_sync is only done if the luma loop restoration is enabled (i.e., rst_info[plane].frame_restoration_type is not RESTORE_NONE).

Detailed description of fix:
The fix modifies the foreach_rest_unit_in_planes_mt function in the thread_common.c file. After the loop declaration for iterating over each plane, the code checks if luma loop restoration is enabled for the current plane using the condition:

  `if (cm->rst_info[plane].frame_restoration_type == RESTORE_NONE) continue;`

If the above condition is true (i.e., luma loop restoration is disabled for the current plane), the code skips the rest of the loop iteration and moves to the next plane.

This fix ensures that the initialization of cur_sb_col in lr_sync is only performed when it is necessary for the enabled planes, preventing incorrect initialization and potential issues in the code.
