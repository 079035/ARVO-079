Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is that the `raise_exception` function is not defined in the `helper.c` file, but it is being called in the `HELPER(movec)` function.

Summary of the fix:
The fix in this patch is to replace the undefined function call `raise_exception` with the correct function call `helper_raise_exception` in the `HELPER(movec)` function.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the given diff file, the `raise_exception` function is called inside the `HELPER(movec)` function, but this function is not defined in the `helper.c` file. To fix this issue, the correct function call `helper_raise_exception` is used in the `HELPER(movec)` function.

The `raise_exception` function is implemented in another file called `op_helper.c` and has the following signature: `void HELPER(raise_exception)(CPUM68KState *env, uint32_t tt);`. The correct way to call this function is by using `helper_raise_exception`, which is a macro defined in the codebase. By replacing the undefined function call with the correct one, the code now makes the intended call to `helper_raise_exception` which raises the specified exception when required.

This fix ensures that the `HELPER(movec)` function correctly calls the `helper_raise_exception` function, fixing the undefined function vulnerability in the code.
