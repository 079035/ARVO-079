Vulnerability:
The vulnerability addressed in this patch is related to the handling of end-of-text conditions in the InsertionSubtable struct.

Summary of the fix:
The fix ensures that the insertion of glyphs is performed correctly when the end-of-text conditions are encountered.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The patch modifies the `transition` function in the `driver_context_t` struct. This function is responsible for performing the glyph insertion based on the current state and flags.
2. Previously, the function did not handle the case when the end-of-text condition was encountered. It would perform operations based on the `DontAdvance` flag, which resulted in incorrect glyph positioning.
3. The fixed code now correctly checks for the `DontAdvance` flag and adjusts the glyph positioning accordingly. If the flag is set, the function moves the buffer position to `end`, meaning that newly inserted glyphs will be visible. If the flag is not set, the function moves the buffer position to `end + count`, allowing for proper insertion of the glyphs.
4. Additionally, the code now checks the validity and bounds of the insertion glyph table before performing the insertion, using the `unlikely` macro and the `check_array` function from the sanitizer.
5. Finally, the code sets the `mark_set` and `mark` variables when the `SetMark` flag is encountered, indicating that the current position should be marked for future reference.

Overall, the fix ensures that the insertion of glyphs is handled correctly, taking into account the end-of-text conditions and the appropriate positioning of the inserted glyphs.
