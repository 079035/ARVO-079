Vulnerability: The vulnerability fixed in this diff is related to the "LookupFormat10" struct in the "hb-aat-layout-common.hh" file. Specifically, there was a bug in the "DEFINE_SIZE_ARRAY" macro that defined the size of the "valueArrayZ" member.

Summary of the fix: The fix updated the size parameter of the "DEFINE_SIZE_ARRAY" macro from 6 to 8.

Detailed description of the fix: The "DEFINE_SIZE_ARRAY" macro is used to define a member variable of the "LookupFormat10" struct called "valueArrayZ". It specifies the size of the array based on the value of the "valueSize" member. However, there was a discrepancy in the size parameter specified in the macro and the actual size needed, resulting in a potential buffer overflow vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, the size parameter in the "DEFINE_SIZE_ARRAY" macro was updated from 6 to 8. This ensures that the "valueArrayZ" member has enough space to hold the required data and prevents any potential buffer overflow issues.

By making this change, the fix ensures that the "valueArrayZ" member is correctly sized based on the "valueSize" parameter specified in the struct, which eliminates the buffer overflow vulnerability.
