Vulnerability: Access violation in Format3
Summary of the fix: The fix aims to prevent an access violation in Format3.
Detailed description of the fix: In the given code, there was a potential vulnerability related to accessing arrays without proper bounds checking. The fix for this vulnerability involved several changes. 

1. The function `get_kerning` had the potential to access arrays `kernValue`, `leftClass`, `rightClass`, and `kernIndex` without proper bounds checking. The fix added bounds checking to ensure that the indices accessed are within the valid range of the respective arrays.

2. The function `sanitize` previously had a return statement that always returned true. The fix removed this line, as it was unnecessary and could have misled the code reader. 

3. Some parts of the code were wrapped in an `#if 0` conditional statement, indicating that they were disabled. The fix removed these disabled parts as they were not contributing to the code functionality and were not necessary for the fix.

4. The `flags` member variable, previously set to zero, was marked as reserved for future use. The fix did not make any changes to this member variable.
