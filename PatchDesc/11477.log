Vulnerability:
The vulnerability being patched in this diff file is a misinterpretation of the existing_frame_idx variable. The code mistakenly uses existing_frame_idx to access the frame_bufs array, causing incorrect buffer access.

Summary of the fix:
The fix addresses the misinterpretation of existing_frame_idx by using the correct ref_frame_map index to access the frame_bufs array.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The fix first initializes the BufferPool and RefCntBuffer variables, pool and frame_bufs respectively, using the cm->buffer_pool field.
2. The assert statement checks if cm->show_existing_frame is true, indicating that an existing frame is being shown.
3. The current_frame is set to a KEY_FRAME, indicating that it is a key frame.
4. The refresh_frame_flags variable is set to (1 << REF_FRAMES) - 1, representing all reference frames.
5. The for loop iterates over the INTER_REFS_PER_FRAME array in cm->current_frame.frame_refs[] and sets each buf element to NULL.
6. If pbi->need_resync is true, the reset_ref_frame_map() function is called to reset the reference frame map in cm.
7. The intra_only flag is set to 1, indicating that the frame is an intra frame.
8. If cm->seq_params.frame_id_numbers_present_flag is true, the code updates the reference frame id values and marks frames as valid for reference based on the refresh_frame_flags bitmask and display_frame_id.
9. The refresh_frame_context is set to REFRESH_FRAME_CONTEXT_DISABLED, indicating that the frame context will not be refreshed.
10. The generate_next_ref_frame_map() function is called to generate the next reference frame map.
11. The fix reloads the adapted CDFs (Context Dependent Frequencies) from when the keyframe was originally coded by assigning the frame_context of the corresponding reference frame in frame_bufs to cm->fc.
