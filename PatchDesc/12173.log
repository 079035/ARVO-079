Vulnerability: 
The vulnerability that is patched in this diff file is that the `conn->data` field is not being set when invoking the protocol-specific disconnect function. This can result in the disconnect function not working correctly because it requires a transfer for its connection.

Summary of Fix:
The fix in this patch is to explicitly set the `conn->data` field to point to the current transfer when invoking the protocol-specific disconnect function.

Detailed Description of Fix:
In the `Curl_disconnect()` function, before calling the protocol-specific disconnect handler, the `conn->data` field is set to point to the current transfer `data`. This ensures that the protocol-specific disconnect function has a valid transfer to work with. The fix adds the following code:
```c
conn->data = data;
```
This allows the protocol-specific disconnect function to access and manipulate the transfer data correctly. After setting the `conn->data` field, the disconnect handler is invoked using `conn->handler->disconnect(conn, dead_connection)`. This ensures that any necessary cleanup and disconnection logic specific to the protocol used for the transfer is performed correctly.

By explicitly setting the `conn->data` field, the fix ensures that the disconnect function can work correctly and performs the necessary cleanup and disconnection steps. This prevents any potential issues or vulnerabilities that may arise from not setting the `conn->data` field properly.
