Vulnerability:
There is an index out-of-bounds vulnerability in the code.

Summary of the fix:
The fix changes the assert condition to avoid the index out-of-bounds warning.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the original code, the assert condition checks whether the end address of the reserved area in the `mBuffer` is greater than or equal to the start address of `GetHelpData()` plus the size of `GetHelpData()`. This condition can lead to an index out-of-bounds error if the address of `GetHelpData()` is greater than the start address of `mBuffer`. 

The fix modifies the assert condition to check whether the reserved size in `mBuffer` is greater than or equal to the sum of the size of `GetHelpData()` and the difference between the address of `GetHelpData()` and the start address of `mBuffer.mData`. This ensures that the reserved area is sufficient to accommodate `GetHelpData()` and any additional data before it. 

This fix prevents potential out-of-bounds access and improves the code's safety.
