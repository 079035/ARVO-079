Vulnerability: This code patch fixes a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `CoapSecure::Process` function. 

Summary of Fix: The fix adds length checks for the input arguments `argv[2]` and `argv[3]` when setting the PSK (pre-shared key) in the `CoapSecure` class. The length of these arguments is now checked against the size of the destination buffer `mPsk` and `mPskId` respectively.

Detailed Description of Fix:
1. In the original code, the length of `argv[2]` is calculated using `strlen(argv[2])` and stored in the variable `mPskLength`. Similarly, the length of `argv[3]` is calculated and stored in `mPskIdLength`. This leaves the possibility of a buffer overflow if the lengths of `argv[2]` and `argv[3]` are greater than the sizes of `mPsk` and `mPskId` buffers respectively.

2. In the fix, the variable `length` is introduced to hold the length of the input arguments. The `strlen` function is then called to calculate the length and assign it to `length`. 

3. Next, a check is added to verify that `length` is less than or equal to the size of the respective destination buffer (i.e., `sizeof(mPsk)` for `argv[2]` and `sizeof(mPskId)` for `argv[3]`). If the length is greater than the buffer size, the code exits with an error (`OT_ERROR_INVALID_ARGS`).

4. If the length check passes, the data from `argv[2]` and `argv[3]` is copied to the respective destination buffers (`mPsk` and `mPskId`), and the `otCoapSecureSetPsk` function is called with the updated PSK and PSK ID lengths.

5. This fix prevents potential buffer overflows by ensuring that the input arguments for setting the PSK are within the bounds of the destination buffers.
