Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that is being patched in this diff file is a potential buffer overflow when setting the PSK (Preshared Key) and client ID in the `coaps set psk` command.

Summary of the fix:
The fix adds length checks before copying the PSK and client ID strings, ensuring that they do not exceed the maximum allowed length.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The fix modifies the code block in the `coaps set psk` command where the PSK and client ID strings are being copied.
2. It introduces a new variable `length` of type `size_t` to store the length of the PSK and client ID strings.
3. The length of the PSK string is checked using the `strlen` function, and then compared against the maximum allowed length using the `VerifyOrExit` macro. If the length exceeds the allowed length, the function exits with an error.
4. If the PSK length check passes, the PSK string is copied using the `memcpy` function.
5. The length of the client ID string is checked in a similar manner, and if it passes the check, the client ID string is copied using `memcpy`.
6. The `otCoapSecureSetPsk` function is then called with the validated PSK and client ID strings.
7. The `mUseCertificate` flag is set to `false` to indicate that a PSK is being used instead of a certificate.
8. The patched code also includes error handling for invalid arguments, ensuring that the function exits with an error if necessary.

Overall, the fix adds length checks before copying the PSK and client ID strings, ensuring that no buffer overflow occurs when setting the PSK.
