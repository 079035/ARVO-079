Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code is a potential heap overflow. 

Summary of the fix:
The fix includes adding boundary checks to prevent accessing the array out-of-bounds.

Detailed description of the fix:
The vulnerability is fixed by adding two boundary checks at lines 432 and 437. The first boundary check is added after the condition `if (c_char != 0)` to check if `i` is not equal to zero before decrementing it. Similarly, the second boundary check is added after the condition `if (c_char1 == 0)` to check if `i` is not equal to zero before decrementing it. These boundary checks ensure that the loop terminates gracefully and does not access the array out-of-bounds.
