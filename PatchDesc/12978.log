Vulnerability:

The vulnerability patched in the given diff file is the removal of the `--enable-static-iconv` option from the `configure.ac` file.

Summary of the fix:

The fix consists of removing the `AC_ARG_ENABLE` line related to `static-iconv` from the `configure.ac` file.

Detailed description of the fix:

1. The `AC_ARG_ENABLE` macro is used in the `configure.ac` file to define command line options that can be passed to the `configure` script. It takes multiple arguments, including the name of the option, a help message, a variable to store the result, and a default value.

2. In the original code, the `AC_ARG_ENABLE` macro was used to define the `--enable-static-iconv` option. This option allowed the user to specify whether the `iconv` library should be linked statically or dynamically. The result of this option was stored in the `static_iconv` variable.

3. However, in the patch, the `AC_ARG_ENABLE` line related to `static-iconv` is removed from the `configure.ac` file. This means that the `--enable-static-iconv` option is no longer available.

4. The reason for removing this option is not mentioned in the diff file. It could be due to various reasons, such as the option being no longer necessary or causing issues.

5. The removal of this option indicates that the decision on whether to link the `iconv` library statically or dynamically is now determined by some other mechanism or configuration. The exact details of how this decision is made and implemented are not provided in the given diff file.
