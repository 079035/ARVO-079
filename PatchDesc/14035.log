Vulnerability: The vulnerability addressed in this patch is the usage of a magic number (17) in a loop condition. This magic number is used to iterate over an array, and it assumes that the array has a specific length. However, using a magic number makes the code less maintainable and prone to errors if the array length changes in the future.

Summary of the fix: The fix removes the magic number (17) and replaces it with a constant called MAX_DPB_COUNT. This change improves the code's readability and maintainability by using a named constant instead of a magic number.

Detailed description of the fix: The fix modifies the for loop condition in the code snippet from `for (int32_t i = 0; i < 17; ++i)` to `for (int32_t i = 0; i < MAX_DPB_COUNT; ++i)`. The constant MAX_DPB_COUNT represents the maximum number of elements in the array. By using this constant, the code becomes more flexible and easier to maintain. If the length of the array changes in the future, only the value of MAX_DPB_COUNT needs to be updated, rather than every occurrence of the magic number 17 in the code. This change helps prevent potential bugs and makes the code more robust.
