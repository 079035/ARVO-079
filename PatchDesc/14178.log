Vulnerability:
In the given code, there is a vulnerability related to an unchecked array index used to set the operand type in the printSVERegOp function.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix for this vulnerability involves setting the operand type and register value in the instruction detail structure for the ARM64 architecture.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
1. In the given code, the vulnerability is present in the printSVERegOp function.
2. The function initializes the variable "Reg" with the value of the register obtained from the MCInst.
3. The fix involves adding code to set the operand type and register value in the MI->flat_insn->detail->arm64.operands array, which is a part of the MCInst structure.
4. The operand type is set as ARM64_OP_REG, indicating that the operand is a register.
5. The register value is set as "Reg", obtained from the MCInst.
6. The op_count is incremented to reflect the addition of a new operand.
7. The fix ensures that the operand type and value are properly set in the instruction detail structure for the ARM64 architecture.
8. This fix mitigates the vulnerability by correctly assigning the operand type and register value, preventing any potential misuse or undefined behavior.
