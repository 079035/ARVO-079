Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in this code is a potential use-after-free issue. In the function `DecreasePicBuff`, the code frees the `pPicOldBuf` memory using `pMa->WelsFree`, but it does not update the `pPicOldBuf` pointer to NULL after the memory is freed. This can lead to a situation where the pointer is accessed again later in the code, resulting in undefined behavior.

Fix Summary:
The fix for this vulnerability involves updating the `pPicOldBuf` pointer to NULL after freeing the memory in the `DecreasePicBuff` function.

Detailed Fix Description:
To fix the vulnerability, the code needs to be modified as follows:

```c
// remove old PicBuf
if (pPicOldBuf->ppPic != NULL) {
  pMa->WelsFree (pPicOldBuf->ppPic, "pPicOldBuf->queue");
  pPicOldBuf->ppPic = NULL;
}
pPicOldBuf->iCapacity = 0;
pPicOldBuf->iCurrentIdx = 0;
pMa->WelsFree (pPicOldBuf, "pPicOldBuf");
pPicOldBuf = NULL;  // <-- Add this line to set the pointer to NULL after freeing the memory
```

By setting the `pPicOldBuf` pointer to NULL after freeing the memory, we ensure that the pointer is not accessed again later in the code, preventing any potential use-after-free issues.
