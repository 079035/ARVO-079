Vulnerability:

The vulnerability that is being patched in this diff file is a buffer overflow in the dotnet module of the libyara library.

Summary of the fix:

The fix for the buffer overflow vulnerability involves adding a check for the size of the blob before parsing it. If the size is 0, the parsing is stopped. This prevents the overflow from occurring.

Detailed description of the fix:

1. In the `dotnet_parse_us` function, a check is added to ensure that `blob_result.size` is not 0:
```
if (blob_result.size == 0)
  break;
```
This check breaks out of the loop if the size is 0, preventing the parsing of empty blobs and avoiding the buffer overflow.

2. Additionally, the check for whether the blob size fits in the PE is moved inside the condition that checks if the length of the blob is greater than 0:
```
if (blob_result.length > 0 && fits_in_pe(pe, offset, blob_result.length))
```
This ensures that the size of the blob is checked only if the length is greater than 0, preventing unnecessary checks for empty blobs.

3. The `set_integer` function is called to set the number of user strings found:
```
set_integer(i, pe->object, "number_of_user_strings");
```
This function sets the value of the specified integer attribute in the `pe` object.

Overall, these changes in the code prevent the buffer overflow by checking the size of the blob before parsing it and avoiding empty blobs.
