Vulnerability: Insufficient Input Validation
Summary of the fix: The fix ensures that there is a full request after ignoring leading whitespace.
Detailed description of the fix: 

1. The code defines a constant `min_request_size` as the minimum size of a valid HTTP request (excluding leading whitespace). It is set to the size of the string "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n" minus 1.
2. The code checks if the length of the buffer is less than `min_request_size`. If it is, the code returns a HTTP_BAD_REQUEST status, indicating an incomplete or invalid request.
3. The code then checks if the buffer (after ignoring leading whitespace) is at or beyond the end of the request buffer minus `min_request_size`. If it is, the code returns a HTTP_BAD_REQUEST status, indicating an incomplete or invalid request.
4. If the above checks pass, the code proceeds with parsing the HTTP request as usual.

These changes ensure that the code validates the input and only proceeds with parsing if there is a full request after ignoring leading whitespace. This helps prevent potential vulnerabilities or crashes caused by invalid or incomplete requests.
