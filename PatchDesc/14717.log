Vulnerability:
The vulnerability being patched in this diff file is a potential security issue in the `averageImages` function of the Magick++ library. 

Summary of Fix:
The fix ensures that the `averageImages` function is correctly computing the signature of the averaged image. 

Detailed Description of Fix:
In the original code, there is a check for the signature of the averaged image to validate its correctness. However, there is a vulnerability where the check fails for certain signatures. 

The fix in this diff file updates the check for the signature of the averaged image. It adds an additional condition to the check to account for a new valid signature. This ensures that the check passes for all valid cases and prevents false positives.

With the addition of the new condition, the `averageImages` function now accurately computes and validates the signature of the averaged image, preventing any potential security issues.
