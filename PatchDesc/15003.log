Vulnerability:
The vulnerability fixed in this diff is a crash that occurs when parsing 1 byte truncated omf files (#14227).

Summary of the Fix:
The fix addresses the crash by modifying how the `rec_size` and `str_size` variables are calculated and by adding error handling in the loop that checks if the string is ASCII.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
1. In the original code, `rec_size` is calculated by reading a 16-bit little-endian value from bytes 2 and 3 of the buffer. The fix changes this calculation to use the `r_buf_read_le16_at()` function to read the value directly from the buffer.
   - Before: `ut16 rec_size = ut8p_bw (buf + 1);`
   - After: `ut16 rec_size = r_buf_read_le16_at (b, 1);`
   
2. In the original code, `str_size` is assigned the value of byte 3 of the buffer using a simple assignment. The fix changes this assignment to use the `r_buf_read_at()` function to read the value from the buffer.
   - Before: `ut8 str_size = *(buf + 3);`
   - After: `ut8 str_size; (void)r_buf_read_at (b, 3, &str_size, 1);`
   
3. In the original code, the loop that checks if the string is ASCII iterates from index 4 to `str_size + 4`. The fix modifies the loop to check the ASCII value of each character using the `r_buf_read_at()` function and adds error handling for cases where there may not be enough bytes to read.
   - Before: `for (i = 4; i < str_size + 4; ++i) { ... }`
   - After: 
     ```
     for (i = 4; i < str_size + 4; i++) {
         if (r_buf_read_at (b, i, &ch, 1) != 1) {
             break;
         }
         if (ch > 0x7f) {
             return false;
         }
     }
     ```
     
4. The fix also adds a new line just before the final return statement to get the pointer to the buffer data.
   - After: `const ut8 *buf = r_buf_data (b, NULL);`
   
Overall, the fix improves the handling of the buffer and adds error handling to prevent crashes when parsing 1 byte truncated omf files.
