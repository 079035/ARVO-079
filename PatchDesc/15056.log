Vulnerability:

The vulnerability patched in this diff file is a missing termination element in the `ne_mastering_metadata_elements` array.

Summary of the fix:

The fix adds a missing termination element to the `ne_mastering_metadata_elements` array.

Detailed description of the fix:

The diff file shows a commit that adds the missing termination element to the `ne_mastering_metadata_elements` array. The array is defined as a list of `ebml_element_desc` structures, which describe the elements of an EBML (Extensible Binary Meta Language) structure. The elements in the array specify various fields of a `struct mastering_metadata` object.

Before the fix, the `ne_mastering_metadata_elements` array was missing the termination element that signals the end of the list. This could potentially lead to issues when accessing the array, as the termination element acts as a marker for the end of the list.

The fix inserts a new line `E_LAST` at the end of the `ne_mastering_metadata_elements` array. This termination element ensures that any iteration or processing of the array knows when it has reached the end.

By adding the missing termination element, the fix ensures that the `ne_mastering_metadata_elements` array is properly defined and can be safely accessed without any unintended behavior.
