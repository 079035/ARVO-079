Vulnerability: 
The vulnerability in this code is a potential null pointer dereference. 

Summary of the fix:
The fix in this code is to check if the value of "fc.datasize" is greater than 0 before allocating memory for the buffer.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. In the original code, memory was allocated for the buffer "buf" using the "calloc" function without checking if "fc.datasize" is greater than 0. This could lead to a potential null pointer dereference if "fc.datasize" is 0, causing a crash.
2. In the fix, a check is added to ensure that "fc.datasize" is greater than 0 before allocating memory for the buffer. If it is not, the variable "bin->func_start" is set to NULL and the function returns false.
3. If "fc.datasize" is greater than 0, the memory is allocated for the buffer "buf" using "calloc", and the rest of the logic remains unchanged.
4. Finally, the "bin->func_start" is set to the allocated buffer "buf" and the function returns true indicating a successful fix.
