Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that could be patched in the provided diff file is an invalid memory free.

Summary of the fix:
The fix involves adding a check for the success of the HEIF image decoding operation, and if it fails, freeing the resources and returning false.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. A check is added after the `heif_decode_image` function call to verify the success of the decoding operation. If the operation fails, the image handle is released and false is returned.
2. The check for the success of the `heif_decode_image` function was previously placed inside the conditional block for `decode_options`, which caused a memory leak if the decoding failed. To fix this, the check is moved outside the conditional block.
3. In case the `SetImageExtent` function call fails later in the code, the resources are freed and false is returned.

The fix ensures that if the decoding operation fails or the image extent cannot be set, the resources are properly freed before returning false, preventing an invalid free vulnerability.
