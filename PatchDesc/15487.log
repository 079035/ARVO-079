Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the provided diff file is that the code does not handle the compression type properly. The code mistakenly changes the compression type from "ZipCompression" to "RLECompression" without checking if "ZipCompression" was the original compression type set for the image. This can result in the loss of data or incorrect display of the compressed image.

Summary of fix:
The fix ensures that the compression type is properly handled by checking the original compression type before changing it.

Detailed description of fix:
To fix the vulnerability, the following changes were made to the code:
1. The code now stores the original compression type in a variable called `compression`.
2. Before changing the compression type, the code checks if the original compression type was "ZipCompression".
3. If the original compression type was "ZipCompression", the code sets the compression type to "RLECompression".
4. After writing the image with the updated compression type, the code restores the original compression type from the `compression` variable.
