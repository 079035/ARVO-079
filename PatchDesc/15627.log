Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the provided diff file is a potential buffer overflow in the function `CheckRemainingPDFBuffer()`. The check `if (buffer->offset+length > sizeof(buffer->data))` does not account for the possibility of `buffer->offset+length` exceeding the size of `buffer->data`, which can lead to writing beyond the bounds of the array.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix includes adding a boundary check to ensure that `buffer->offset+length` does not exceed the size of `buffer->data`. If the condition is true, the function `MovePDFBuffer()` is called to handle the excess data.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
1. In the `CheckRemainingPDFBuffer()` function, the condition `if (buffer->offset+length > sizeof(buffer->data))` is modified to `if (buffer->offset+length >= sizeof(buffer->data))`.
2. Inside the modified condition, the statement `(void) MovePDFBuffer(buffer)` is added. This calls the `MovePDFBuffer()` function to handle the excess data when the boundary check condition is true.
3. In the `SkipPDFBytes()` function, an additional condition is introduced before incrementing `buffer->offset`. The new condition `if (buffer->offset+count < buffer->count)` ensures that `buffer->offset+count` does not exceed `buffer->count`.

This fix ensures that proper boundary checks are performed to prevent buffer overflows and the writing of data beyond the bounds of the array `buffer->data`.
