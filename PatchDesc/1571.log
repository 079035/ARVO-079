Vulnerability:
This patch fixes a global-buffer-overflow error reported by AddressSanitizer (ASAN).
The vulnerability is caused by an incorrect use of the structure macro M_NEXT_EXIST. There is a missing closing parenthesis in the M_NEXT_EXIST macro, causing the subsequent lines of code to be parsed incorrectly.

Fix Summary:
The fix involves adding the missing closing parenthesis after the line with M_NEXT_EXIST, and removing the commented out lines.

Detailed Fix Description:
In the diff file, after the line with M_NEXT_EXIST, there is a missing closing parenthesis. This causes the subsequent lines to be treated as arguments to the M_NEXT_EXIST macro, resulting in a parsing error. The fix involves adding the missing closing parenthesis after the M_NEXT_EXIST line. Additionally, the commented out lines that were not needed are removed.

Fixed code snippet:
```c
M_NEXT_EXIST (Ext_Channel_Request_desc_t, Exist_Ext_Channel_Request_desc, 1, &hf_Ext_Channel_Request_desc_exist),
M_TYPE       (Ext_Channel_Request_desc_t, Ext_Channel_Request_desc, Ext_Channel_Request_desc_t),
M_UINT       (Ext_Channel_Request_desc_t, Exist_Ext_Channel_Request_desc, 1, &hf_Ext_Channel_Request_desc_exist),
```
After applying this fix, the code will be correctly parsed, eliminating the global-buffer-overflow vulnerability reported by ASAN.
