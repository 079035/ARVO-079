Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that could be patched in the given diff file is an out-of-bounds vector access.

Summary of the fix:
The fix resolves the out-of-bounds vector access issue by adding proper checks and conditions while accessing vector elements.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. In the function `parseCompoundSelector()`, the fix starts by initializing an empty compound selector wrapper.
2. The fix then skips initial white-space, lexes the input, and checks if the parent selector '&' is present. If it is present, it sets the `hasRealParent` flag to true.
3. The fix then enters a loop to parse the list of simple selectors.
4. Within the loop, it removes all block comments and checks if the parent selector '&' is present again. If it is present, it throws an error.
5. The fix then checks if a functional or type selector is present and appends it to the compound selector wrapper.
6. It also checks for abort conditions such as spaces, end of file, selector combinator operators, and complex selector delimiters. If any of these conditions are met, the loop breaks.
7. Finally, the fix checks if the compound selector wrapper is empty and if the next character is not the start of a block ('{'). If these conditions are met, it sets the `hasPostLineBreak` flag based on the presence of a new line character.
