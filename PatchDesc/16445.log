1. Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code is a Buffer Overflow vulnerability. This occurs in the Legacy (v0.3) Raw Literals Decompression function. The vulnerability arises when the size of the literals (litSize) is greater than the source size (srcSize) minus 11, which could lead to reading too far with wildcopy, causing a buffer overflow.

2. Short Summary of the Fix:
The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the size of the literals (litSize) does not exceed the block size (BLOCKSIZE). If it does, an error is returned, preventing the buffer overflow.

3. Detailed Description of the Fix:
In the case of IS_RAW, a check has been added to ensure that the size of the literals (litSize) does not exceed the block size (BLOCKSIZE). If the litSize is greater than BLOCKSIZE, the function returns an error (ERROR(corruption_detected)). This prevents the buffer overflow that could occur if the litSize is too large. This check is in addition to the existing check that ensures that litSize is not greater than srcSize minus 3. If either of these conditions is not met, the function returns an error, preventing the buffer overflow.
