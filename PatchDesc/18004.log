Vulnerability:
This patch disables authentication in the code by setting the `sctp_auth_enable` sysctl option to 0.

Summary of the fix:
The fix disables authentication in the code by setting a specific sysctl option to 0.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the given diff file, the fix is implemented by adding the line `usrsctp_sysctl_set_sctp_auth_enable(0);`. This line disables authentication in the code by setting the `sctp_auth_enable` sysctl option to 0. By doing this, any authentication mechanisms that may be present in the code are effectively turned off.

Before the fix, authentication may have been enabled, meaning that the code could potentially perform some kind of authentication process. However, it is considered a vulnerability in this specific case to have authentication enabled, so this fix disables it.

It's important to note that without further context, it is difficult to determine the exact reason for disabling authentication. The commit message and diff file do not provide sufficient information to understand the motivations behind this change.
