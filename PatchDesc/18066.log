Vulnerability: Out of boundary vector access

Summary of the fix: The fix addresses the issue of out of boundary vector access by adding a check for an empty vector at the beginning of the `permutate` and `permutateAlt` functions.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The fix checks if the input vector (`in`) is empty at the beginning of the `permutate` and `permutateAlt` functions using the condition `if (L == 0) return {};`.
2. If the input vector is empty, an empty vector is returned indicating an early exit from the functions.
3. Additionally, a check is added to exit early if any of the sub-vectors (`in[i]`) within the input vector is also empty using the condition `if (in[i].size() == 0) return {};`.
4. These checks prevent accessing elements of an empty vector, avoiding potential out of boundary errors.
5. The rest of the code in the `permutate` and `permutateAlt` functions remains the same, ensuring all states are properly initialized and permutations are created.

This fix addresses the vulnerability of out of boundary vector access by preventing the execution of the code that would lead to such access when the input vector or sub-vectors are empty.
