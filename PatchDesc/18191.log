Vulnerability:
The vulnerability patched in the given diff file is that there is a potential buffer overflow in the `ParseXPMColor` function. This function is used to parse color values in the XPM image file. Specifically, the `target` array is not properly null-terminated, which can lead to a buffer overflow when performing string operations on it.

Summary of the fix:
The fix addresses the buffer overflow vulnerability by adding a call to `memset` to properly null-terminate the `target` array before using it. This ensures that any subsequent string operations on `target` will not go beyond the allocated memory.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. Line 298: `(void) memset(target,0,sizeof(target));` - This line adds a call to `memset` to set all elements of the `target` array to 0. This ensures that `target` is properly null-terminated before further operations.

2. Line 321: `(void) memset(symbolic,0,sizeof(symbolic));` - Similarly, this line adds a call to `memset` to set all elements of the `symbolic` array to 0. This ensures that `symbolic` is properly null-terminated before further operations.

These additions of `memset` ensure that the `target` and `symbolic` arrays are properly null-terminated, preventing any buffer overflow when performing subsequent string operations on them.
