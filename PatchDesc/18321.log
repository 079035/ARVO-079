Vulnerability: Out-of-bounds read in strlen

Summary of the fix:
The fix in the given diff file involves initializing the `trie` variable using `calloc` instead of `malloc`, with an additional byte for null termination. This ensures that the `trie` memory is properly initialized and avoids any potential out-of-bounds read in `strlen`.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. In the original code, the `trie` memory is allocated using `malloc` without initializing it.
2. The `size` of the `trie` memory is calculated based on `bin->dyld_info->export_size` and then allocated using `malloc`.
3. The `trie` memory is then filled using `r_buf_read_at` to read data from `bin->dyld_info->export_off`.
4. The fix replaces the `malloc` call with `calloc` to allocate the `trie` memory. In `calloc`, the `size` is increased by 1 to make room for null termination.
5. `calloc` initializes all bytes in the allocated memory to zero, ensuring that the memory is properly initialized.
6. This fix prevents any potential out-of-bounds read in the subsequent code that relies on the `trie` memory, such as `strlen` operations.

Overall, the fix ensures that the `trie` memory is properly initialized and prevents any out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities.
