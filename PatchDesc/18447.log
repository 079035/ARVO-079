Vulnerability:
The vulnerability being patched in this diff file is a buffer overflow in the config file reader fuzzer.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix appears to be addressing the buffer overflow issue in the config file reader fuzzer.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
In the code, the function `config_open_for_fuzzing` is defined for fuzzing purposes when the `FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION` flag is enabled. The function first allocates memory for a `config` structure using `malloc`. However, there is a potential buffer overflow issue in the subsequent call to `config_init_data` which could lead to memory corruption.

To fix the issue, the fix subtracts 1 from the `len` argument passed to `config_init_data` when initializing the `config` structure. By reducing the length by 1, the fix ensures that the allocated memory is sufficient to hold the provided data without overflowing the buffer.

This fix prevents the buffer overflow vulnerability from being exploited, thus improving the overall security of the code.
