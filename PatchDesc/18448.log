Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is a crash while parsing a section.

Summary of the fix:
The fix addresses a crash issue that occurs when parsing a section by checking if the section is empty before parsing.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The fix first checks if the `value` field of the `lexeme` is empty or not.
2. If the `value` field is empty, an error message is logged using `lwan_status_error()` function with the message "Section is empty".
3. The function then returns `NULL`.
4. If the `value` field is not empty, the code continues with the parsing process.
5. The parsed section name is appended to the `strbuf`.
6. The length of the section name is stored in the variable `name_len`.
7. Then, a loop iterates through the remaining `lexeme`s and appends their values to the `strbuf`.
8. If the `lexeme` buffer is not empty, a space character is also appended.
9. Finally, a `config_line` structure is populated with the necessary values and emitted to the `items` buffer using the `config_buffer_emit()` function.
10. The function returns `parse_config`, indicating the successful parsing of the section.
