Vulnerability: Buffer overflow in config file reader fuzzer

Summary of fix: The fix in this commit addresses a buffer overflow vulnerability in the config file reader fuzzer.

Detailed description of fix: 
1. A buffer overflow vulnerability was present in the `config_open_for_fuzzing` function in the `lwan-config.c` file.
2. The function creates a `config` structure and initializes its values.
3. The vulnerable code is the `config_init_data` function call within the `if (config)` block.
4. In the original code, the `data` size `len` was directly used as an argument to `config_init_data`.
5. The fix subtracts 1 from `len` before passing it to `config_init_data`.
6. By subtracting 1 from `len`, the fix prevents the buffer overflow by making the function read one less byte.
7. This ensures that the `config_init_data` function does not read beyond the boundaries of the `data` buffer.
8. The fix mitigates the vulnerability by ensuring that the size passed to `config_init_data` is within the expected boundaries.
9. This prevents potential buffer overflows and improves the security of the code.
10. The fix is considered effective in resolving the buffer overflow vulnerability in the config file reader fuzzer.
