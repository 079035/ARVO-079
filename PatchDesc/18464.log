Vulnerability:
Buffer overflow in config file reader fuzzer.

Summary of the fix:
The fix addresses a buffer overflow vulnerability in the config file reader fuzzer.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the given diff file, the fix is implemented in the function `config_open_for_fuzzing` which is used for fuzzing. The fix involves modifying the `return` statement in the function. Originally, the function called `config_init_data` with the `len` argument as-is. However, in the fix, the `len` argument is decremented by 1 before being passed to `config_init_data`. This effectively prevents a potential buffer overflow by ensuring that the length of the data being passed is reduced by 1. By doing so, the fix ensures that the buffer bounds are not exceeded during the initialization process, addressing the buffer overflow vulnerability.
