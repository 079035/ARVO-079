Vulnerability:
There is an invalid buffer access vulnerability in the code.

Summary of the fix:
The fix is aimed at preventing the invalid buffer access by checking if the buffer move operation succeeds. 

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The code makes use of `buffer->move_to()` function to move the buffer to a specific position.
2. Before the fix, the `buffer->move_to()` function is called without checking if it succeeds.
3. The fix adds a check using `unlikely()` to verify if the `buffer->move_to()` operation fails.
4. If the `buffer->move_to()` operation fails, the loop is broken, and no further changes are made to the buffer.
5. This prevents the invalid buffer access that would have occurred if the `buffer->move_to()` operation failed.
6. The fix helps in preventing incorrect calculation of the "end" variable and avoids potential issues related to buffer length adjustments.

Note: The fix does not provide a complete explanation of the vulnerability. There might exist other vulnerabilities in the code that are not addressed by this fix.
