Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the provided diff file is that there is no check for the existence of input data before attempting to decode it. This can lead to a crash or undefined behavior if there is no input data to decode.

Summary of fix:
The fix in the provided diff file is to add a check for the existence of input data before attempting to decode it. If there is no input data, an exception is thrown with an appropriate error message.

Detailed description of fix:
1. The fix starts by creating a `ByteStream` object `bs` using the `offset` obtained from the IFD (Image File Directory) entry `STRIPOFFSETS`.
   ```cpp
   ByteStream bs(DataBuffer(mFile->getSubView(offset), Endianness::little));
   ```

2. Next, a check is added to verify if the `bs` object has any remaining data to decode.
   ```cpp
   if (bs.getRemainSize() == 0)
       ThrowRDE("No input to decode!");
   ```

3. If there is no remaining data in `bs`, an `RDE` (RawDecoderException) is thrown with the error message "No input to decode!".

4. This check ensures that there is input data available to decode before attempting to proceed with the decoding operation, preventing crashes or undefined behavior.
