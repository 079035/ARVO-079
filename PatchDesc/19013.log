Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is an incorrect comparison in the post_process_template() function. 

Summary of the fix:
The fix corrects the comparison by changing the condition `chunk > last_chunk` to `chunk == last_chunk`.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the post_process_template() function, there are two places where the comparison is being made between `chunk` and `last_chunk` using the '>' operator. However, the correct comparison should be made using the '==' operator. This is because `last_chunk` is the last element in the array, and comparing the pointers using the '>' operator may result in undefined behavior.

The fix updates the comparison condition to use `chunk == last_chunk` instead of `chunk > last_chunk`. This ensures that the correct end condition is checked and prevents any potential out-of-bounds access.
