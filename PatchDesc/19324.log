Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that could be patched in this diff file is related to the insecure use of the LDFLAGS environment variable.

Summary of the fix:
The fix involves changing the value of the LDFLAGS environment variable to include the "-g" option, which adds debug symbols to the build. This helps with debugging and resolving issues in the code.

Detailed description of the fix:
The fix in this diff file can be seen in the following lines:
```
- LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address"
+ LDFLAGS="-g -fsanitize=address"
```
```
- LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=memory"
+ LDFLAGS="-g -fsanitize=memory"
```
```
- LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=undefined"
+ LDFLAGS="-g -fsanitize=undefined"
```
The original value of the LDFLAGS environment variable was set to include the "-fsanitize" option, which enables specific sanitizers like address sanitizer, memory sanitizer, and undefined behavior sanitizer. 
The fix modifies the value of LDFLAGS by adding the "-g" option, which enables the generation of debug symbols during the build process. Debug symbols are essential for debugging and analyzing the code, especially when trying to diagnose and fix issues in the codebase.
By including the "-g" option in LDFLAGS, the fix ensures that the resulting binaries will have debug symbols, making it easier to understand and debug any potential issues or vulnerabilities in the code.
