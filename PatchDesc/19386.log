Vulnerability:
The vulnerability addressed in this patch is a missing length check on the `aNetworkName` parameter in the `GeneratePskc` function of the `Commissioner` class. The code currently checks the length of the `aPassPhrase`, but does not validate the length of the `aNetworkName`, potentially leading to a buffer overflow if the `aNetworkName` exceeds the maximum allowed length.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix adds a length check on the `aNetworkName` parameter in the `GeneratePskc` function to ensure that it does not exceed the maximum allowed length specified by the `OT_NETWORK_NAME_MAX_SIZE` constant.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
1. The fix is implemented by adding a condition to the existing `VerifyOrExit` statement in the `GeneratePskc` function.
2. The condition checks that the length of the `aNetworkName` parameter is less than or equal to the maximum allowed length specified by the `OT_NETWORK_NAME_MAX_SIZE` constant.
3. If the condition is not met, the `OT_ERROR_INVALID_ARGS` error is assigned to the `error` variable, indicating that the arguments passed to the function are invalid.
4. This ensures that the `aNetworkName` length is properly checked and prevents potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the code.
5. The `VerifyOrExit` macro is used to handle the error condition and exit the function if the condition is not met.
6. The `VerifyOrExit` macro is commonly used in OpenThread code to simplify error handling and resource cleanup.
