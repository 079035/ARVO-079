Vulnerability:

This patch fixes a potential vulnerability related to a null termination issue in the `IsFxFunction` function in the `fx.c` file of the MagickCore library.

Summary of Fix:

The fix introduces a check for null termination before accessing the character `c` in the `IsFxFunction` function.

Detailed Description of Fix:

The `IsFxFunction` function is used to determine if a given function name exists in an expression. It checks if the function name matches the provided expression up to its length and if the character after the length is either a space or an opening parenthesis.

Before the fix, the function did not check for null termination in the expression, which could lead to out-of-bounds memory access if the function name was not null-terminated or if the expression was not properly formatted.

The fix adds a check for null termination before accessing the character `c`. If the character `c` is null, the function returns `MagickFalse`, indicating that the expression does not contain the given function name.

This fix ensures that the function does not access memory beyond the expression length and prevents potential security vulnerabilities related to null termination issues.

Overall, this patch enhances the safety and reliability of the `IsFxFunction` function by addressing the null termination issue.
