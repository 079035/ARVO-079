Vulnerability: Insufficient data check for UDP header

Summary of the fix: The fix adds a conditional check to ensure that there is enough data available for the UDP header before processing it.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. In the "if" condition on line 1677, a check is added to verify if the captured packet has enough data for the UDP header. 
2. If the condition fails, the function returns the current value of `nproto`, indicating that the packet processing failed due to insufficient data for the UDP header.

The fix ensures that the code checks for sufficient data before attempting to process the UDP header, preventing potential memory access errors or incorrect processing due to insufficient data.
