Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that could be patched in the given diff file is a potential memory leak. In the function `ReadGRADIENTImage`, the `stops` array is allocated using `AcquireQuantumMemory` but it is never freed.

Summary of the fix:
The fix involves explicitly freeing the allocated `stops` array before returning from the function.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. At line 220, add the code to free the allocated `stops` array:
   ```c
   stops = (StopInfo *) RelinquishMagickMemory(stops);
   ```
   This will release the memory allocated for the `stops` array and prevent a memory leak.

With this fix, the potential memory leak in the `ReadGRADIENTImage` function is patched by correctly freeing the `stops` array before returning from the function.
