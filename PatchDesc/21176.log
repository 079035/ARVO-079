Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is a double free bug. The issue occurs when parsing a DNS response containing an SOA record with multiple answers. If the qclass is T_SOA and the ancount is greater than 1, the function incorrectly frees the `rr_name` pointer twice.

Summary of the fix:
The fix attempts to address the double free bug introduced in the previous commit.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. Before the fix, the code executed the following steps to expand the name for each record in the response:
   - Allocate memory for `rr_name`.
   - Call `ares__expand_name_for_response` function, passing `aptr`, `abuf`, `alen`, `&rr_name`, and `&len`.
   - If the expansion was successful, update `aptr` and proceed with the rest of the code.
2. The fix adds a new line before calling `ares__expand_name_for_response` to set `rr_name` to NULL. This prevents the double free bug when freeing `rr_name` later in the code.
3. The rest of the code remains the same, performing the necessary checks and parsing the SOA record.
4. After successfully parsing the SOA record and storing the data in the `soa` structure, `qname` and `rr_name` are freed, and then `soa` is assigned to `*soa_out`.
5. The function returns `ARES_SUCCESS` as the SOA record is successfully parsed.
6. If no SOA record is found, the code jumps to the `failed_stat` label, setting `status` to `ARES_EBADRESP` and frees `rr_name`.
7. The fix does not address any possible memory leaks or other potential issues in the code.
