Vulnerability:
The vulnerability being patched in this diff file is a potential memory read vulnerability. 

Summary of the fix:
The fix adds a check for the presence of a TLS hello message before reading memory, in order to prevent potential memory read vulnerabilities.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the existing code, there is a check to match a custom category based on the flow's `host_server_name`. However, the fix modifies this condition to include an additional check for the presence of a TLS hello message (`flow->l4.tcp.tls.hello_processed == 1`). This ensures that the memory is only read when the TLS connection has been properly established.

By adding this extra check, the fix prevents potential vulnerabilities that may occur if the memory is read without proper TLS handshake.
