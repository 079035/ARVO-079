1. Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code is a double free vulnerability. This occurs when the code tries to free a Diffie-Hellman (DH) object that has already been freed. This can lead to undefined behavior, including crashes, corruption of data, or even potential security risks such as arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation.

2. Short Summary of the Fix:
The fix involves ensuring that the DH object is not freed twice. This is achieved by setting the DH pointer to NULL after it has been assigned to an EVP_PKEY object, thus preventing it from being freed again later in the code.

3. Detailed Description of the Fix:
In the original code, a DH object is created and assigned to an EVP_PKEY object. However, both the EVP_PKEY object and the original DH object are freed later in the code, leading to a double free vulnerability. 

The fix involves adding a line of code (`dh = NULL;`) after the DH object is assigned to the EVP_PKEY object. This sets the DH pointer to NULL, which means that when the code later attempts to free the DH object, it is actually attempting to free a NULL pointer, which is a safe operation and does not lead to a double free. 

Additionally, the call to `ssl_security` function is updated to use `EVP_PKEY_get0_DH(peer_tmp)` instead of `dh`. This is because `dh` is now NULL, so the original DH object is retrieved from the EVP_PKEY object for the security check.
