Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is that the code is unnecessarily trying to resize a static buffer allocator in the `c_single_allocator` class.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix for the vulnerability is to remove the resizing capability for the static buffer allocator, as it is intended to be fixed in size.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
In the given code, the `c_single_allocator` class is defined to allocate and deallocate a static buffer. However, there is a method called `resize()` that is intended to change the size of the buffer. This is not necessary for a static buffer allocator, as the size is fixed and should not be changed.

To fix this vulnerability, the code in the `resize()` method should be modified to remove the resizing capability. This can be done by commenting out the line that assigns the new size to the `_buf_size` member variable and adding a comment to indicate that the buffer is fixed and the size should not be changed.

Here is the modified code for the `resize()` method:

```cpp
void resize (std::size_t new_size_) {
    // This buffer is fixed, size must not be changed
    LIBZMQ_UNUSED (new_size_);
}
```

With this modification, the code will no longer attempt to resize the static buffer allocator, ensuring that the size remains fixed as intended.
