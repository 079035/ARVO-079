Vulnerability Description:
- There is a potential vulnerability in the ReadTXTImage function in txt.c file.
- The code does not handle the case where the pointer 'q' is NULL, leading to a possible null pointer dereference.

Summary of Fix:
- The fix ensures that if 'q' is NULL, the function returns a destroyed image instead of attempting to access it.

Detailed Fix Description:
1. In the ReadTXTImage function, locate the following code block:
```C
if (q == (Quantum *) NULL)
  continue;
```
2. Replace the code block with the following code:
```C
if (q == (Quantum *) NULL)
{
  status=MagickFalse;
  break;
}
```
3. Save and rebuild the code.

After the fix, if 'q' is NULL, the function will set 'status' to false and break the loop, returning a destroyed image. This prevents the possibility of a null pointer dereference and ensures the code operates correctly.
