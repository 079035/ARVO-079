Vulnerability: Index-out-of-bounds

Summary of fix: Ensure that the correct number of bytes are written to the buffer based on the value of the code.

Detailed description of fix:
In the original code, there is a potential index-out-of-bounds vulnerability. The code checks the value of `code` and based on its value, writes the corresponding byte(s) to the buffer `buf`. However, there is a missing check which leads to potential index-out-of-bounds access. 

In the fixed code, the missing check has been added. The code now checks if the first two bytes should be written to the buffer based on the value of `code` (`(code & 0xff0000) != 0`). If this condition is true, the first two bytes are written to the buffer. Additionally, if the first condition is false but the second two bytes should still be written (`(code & 0xff00) != 0`), the second byte is written to the buffer. Finally, the last byte is always written to the buffer.

This fix ensures that the correct number of bytes are written to the buffer `buf` based on the value of `code`, thereby preventing any index-out-of-bounds vulnerabilities.
