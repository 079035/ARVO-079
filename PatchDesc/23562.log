Vulnerability: Inconsistent installation directory for rpcapd in CMake on non-Windows systems.

Summary of the fix: The fix ensures that rpcapd is installed into the appropriate directory on non-Windows systems, consistent with the logic of recent changes in tcpslice and tcpdump.

Detailed description of the fix:
- The fix includes changes in the CMakeLists.txt file for rpcapd.
- On line 126, the installation destination for rpcapd is modified based on the platform. The previous code installed rpcapd into the "sbin" directory by default, but now it is updated to install into the "bin" directory on non-Windows systems.
- Additionally, on lines 121-128, conditional checks are added to handle the installation destination based on the platform and the size of the void pointer.
- If the platform is not MSVC (i.e., non-Windows systems), rpcapd is installed into the "sbin" directory.
- If the platform is MSVC (i.e., Windows systems), rpcapd is installed into the "bin" directory. The installation destination is further differentiated based on the size of the void pointer, with rpcapd being installed into the "bin/amd64" directory if the void pointer size is 8 (64-bit systems), and into the "bin" directory otherwise (32-bit systems).
- These changes ensure that the installation directory for rpcapd in CMake is consistent with the logic of recent changes in other related projects on non-Windows systems.
