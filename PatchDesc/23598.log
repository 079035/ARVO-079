The vulnerability in the provided diff file is a discrepancy in the installation directory for the rpcapd executable in the CMakeLists.txt file. In this case, CMake has been installing rpcapd into the `bindir` directory, while the autoconf script installs it into the `sbindir` directory. This discrepancy can cause inconsistency between different platforms and distribution methods.

The fix for this vulnerability is to update the installation directory of the rpcapd executable in the CMakeLists.txt file to be consistent with the autoconf script. Specifically, on non-Windows systems, the rpcapd executable should be installed into the `sbin` directory instead of the `bin` directory. Additionally, for Windows systems, the rpcapd executable should be installed into the `bin` directory for 32-bit systems and into the `bin/amd64` directory for 64-bit systems.

Here is the detailed description of the fix:

1. Find the following code block in the CMakeLists.txt file:
   ```
   if(NOT MSVC)
     install(TARGETS rpcapd DESTINATION sbin)
   else(NOT MSVC)
     if(CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P EQUAL 8)
       install(TARGETS rpcapd DESTINATION bin/amd64)
     else(CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P EQUAL 8)
       install(TARGETS rpcapd DESTINATION bin)
     endif(CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P EQUAL 8)
   endif(NOT MSVC)
   ```

2. Replace the code block with the following updated code:
   ```
   if(NOT MSVC)
     install(TARGETS rpcapd DESTINATION sbin)
   else(NOT MSVC)
     if(CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P EQUAL 8)
       install(TARGETS rpcapd DESTINATION bin/amd64)
     else(CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P EQUAL 8)
       install(TARGETS rpcapd DESTINATION bin)
     endif(CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P EQUAL 8)
   endif(NOT MSVC)
   ```

3. Save and build the project to apply the fix. After the fix is applied, the rpcapd executable will be installed into the appropriate directory based on the platform and architecture: `sbin` for non-Windows systems and `bin/amd64` or `bin` for Windows systems.
