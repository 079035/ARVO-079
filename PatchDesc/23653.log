Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is a heap overflow bug. This bug was introduced by commit 9e1758efb to address another issue (oss-fuzz issue 22689) but was only partially fixed by commit 70f58997f. The bug occurs when an empty line is encountered in the configuration file.

Summary of the fix:
The fix correctly deals with empty lines in the configuration file.

Detailed description of the fix:
To fix the issue, the code now checks if the end pointer (end of the current line) is greater than the line pointer before dereferencing end-1. This ensures that the end pointer is valid before checking for a trailing LF character. The fix prevents the heap overflow bug that was occurring when processing empty lines in the configuration file.
