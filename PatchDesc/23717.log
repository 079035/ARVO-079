Vulnerability:
The vulnerability being patched in this diff file is an issue with the `fuzz_decompress` function. It does not validate the header size before performing decompression, which could lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.

Summary of the fix:
The fix introduces a check for validating the header size before performing decompression. If the header size is found to be unexpected, the function returns without further processing.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The fix adds a new check to the `fuzz_decompress` function by calling the `blosc_cbuffer_validate` function with the `data` and `size` parameters.
2. If the return value of `blosc_cbuffer_validate` is non-zero, indicating an unexpected `nbytes` value in the Blosc header, the function returns without performing decompression.
3. This check ensures that the header size is validated before any further processing, preventing potential vulnerabilities resulting from incorrect header values.
4. This fix adds an additional layer of security to the decompression process, ensuring that only valid and expected headers are processed.
