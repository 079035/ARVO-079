Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is that the wrong size is being passed to the `blosc_run_decompression_with_context` function. The function is supposed to receive the `srcsize` parameter as the size of the source data, but instead, it receives `INT32_MAX`, indicating the maximum possible size for a 32-bit signed integer. This can lead to incorrect decompression or even buffer overflows if the `srcsize` parameter is larger than the actual size of the source data.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix involves replacing the incorrect parameter `INT32_MAX` with the correct parameter `srcsize`, ensuring that the function receives the actual size of the source data for proper decompression.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
In the given diff file, we see the following line:

```
result = blosc_run_decompression_with_context(g_global_context, src, INT32_MAX, dest, destsize);
```

This line is replaced with the following line in the fix:

```
result = blosc_run_decompression_with_context(g_global_context, src, srcsize, dest, destsize);
```

In the fix, the `INT32_MAX` parameter is replaced with `srcsize`, which ensures that the function receives the correct size of the source data. This fix ensures that the decompression operation is performed correctly and avoids potential issues such as incorrect decompression or buffer overflows.
