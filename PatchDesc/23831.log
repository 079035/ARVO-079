Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Summary of the Fix: The fix improves the boundary check to prevent an overflow in the code.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
1. The code is part of a function that searches for IAX (Inter-Asterisk eXchange) packets in a network flow.
2. In the "ndpi_search_setup_iax" function, the code checks various conditions to determine if the packet is an IAX packet.
3. The vulnerability lies in the loop that iterates through the packet payload. It calculates the "packet_len" by adding 2 and the value of "packet->payload[packet_len + 1]" to the current "packet_len".
4. The condition `(packet_len+1) >= packet->payload_packet_len` is used to check if the packet length exceeds the payload length. However, this condition is insufficient to prevent an integer overflow.
5. An attacker could craft a malicious packet with a large payload length, causing the addition `packet_len + 2 + packet->payload[packet_len + 1]` to overflow and potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
6. The fix improves the boundary check by including the "+1" term in the condition, `(packet_len+1) >= packet->payload_packet_len`. This ensures that the correct length comparison is performed and prevents an integer overflow.
7. After applying the fix, the code will correctly handle packets with payload lengths that do not result in an overflow, mitigating the vulnerability.
