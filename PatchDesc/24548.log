Vulnerability:

The vulnerability patched in this diff file is related to a missing check for the success of a function call. In the function `serialize()` of the `CmapSubtableFormat14` struct, after some processing, there is a call to `c->check_success()` which checks whether or not to continue with the serialization process. However, this check is missing for the call to `obj_indices.in_error()` before returning. This means that even if there are errors in `obj_indices`, the code will continue to execute and potentially cause undefined behavior or memory corruption.

Summary of the fix:

The fix in this patch involves adding a missing check for the success of the function call `!obj_indices.in_error()` before proceeding with the serialization process. This ensures that if there are any errors in `obj_indices`, the function will return and not continue with potentially unsafe operations.

Detailed description of the fix:

1. The `if` statement `if (unlikely (!c->check_success (!obj_indices.in_error ()))) return;` is added after the calculation of `tail_len`. It checks whether there are any errors in `obj_indices` by calling the `in_error()` function on `obj_indices` and negating the result. If there are errors, the function returns immediately, preventing further execution.

```diff
+    if (unlikely (!c->check_success (!obj_indices.in_error ())))
+      return;
```

2. This change ensures that any potential issues with `obj_indices` are caught and the function exits early without proceeding with the serialization process.

This fix enhances the robustness of the code by preventing the execution of unsafe operations when there are errors in `obj_indices`.
