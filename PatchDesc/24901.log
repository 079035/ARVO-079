Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the diff file is a potential integer overflow in the `ntfs_make_data_run` function. It occurs when calculating the length of the run and the address offset. If the length or the address offset is greater than 8 bytes, the function raises an error and returns `TSK_COR`. This could lead to a denial of service if an attacker is able to trigger this condition.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix in this commit resolves the potential integer overflow issue by checking the size of the run length and address offset fields before processing them. If the size exceeds the allowed limit of 8 bytes, an error is raised and the function returns an appropriate error code (`TSK_COR`). This prevents the integer overflow and mitigates the vulnerability.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
To fix the vulnerability, the following changes were made in the code:

1. The check for the length of the run was updated to use the `NTFS_RUNL_LENSZ` macro. This macro returns the size of the run length field in bytes.
   
   Before Fix:
   ```c
   if (NTFS_RUNL_LENSZ(run) > 8) { ... }
   ```

   After Fix:
   ```c
   if (NTFS_RUNL_LENSZ(run) > 8) { ... }
   ```

2. Similarly, the check for the address offset of the run was updated to use the `NTFS_RUNL_OFFSZ` macro. This macro returns the size of the address offset field in bytes.
   
   Before Fix:
   ```c
   if (NTFS_RUNL_LENSZ(run) > 8) { ... }
   ```

   After Fix:
   ```c
   if (NTFS_RUNL_OFFSZ(run) > 8) { ... }
   ```

These changes ensure that the length and address offset values are within the allowed size limits, preventing any potential integer overflow.
