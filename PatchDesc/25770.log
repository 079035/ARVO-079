Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that could be patched in the given diff file is that the code does not perform a sanity check for reading multipart files with no parts.

Summary of the fix:
The fix adds a sanity check to ensure that the files contain at least one header. If the file does not contain any headers, an exception of type `ArgExc` is thrown.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The fix checks if the number of headers in the file is equal to zero using the condition `_data->_headers.size() == 0`.
2. If the number of headers is zero, it throws an exception of type `ArgExc` with the message "Files must contain at least one header".
3. This fix ensures that multipart files must have at least one header, preventing the code from processing files without any valid parts.
