Vulnerability:
The vulnerability patched in this diff file is related to the decoding of B slice video frames in the openh264 library. When an error occurs during the decoding of a B slice, the decoder was not properly resetting the reordering picture buffers and reference pictures. This could lead to incorrect decoding and potentially cause errors in the output video.

Summary of the fix:
The fix in this patch addresses the issue by resetting the reordering picture buffers and reference pictures when an error occurs during the decoding of a B slice.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the code, after checking for decoding errors, the fix identifies if the error is related to B slice decoding. If the error is indeed related to B slice decoding, the fix calls the function `ResetReorderingPictureBuffers` to reset the reordering picture buffers and `WelsResetRefPic` to reset the reference pictures. This ensures that the subsequent decoding of B slices starts fresh and avoids potential errors introduced by the previous erroneous decoding.

By resetting the reordering picture buffers and reference pictures, the fix ensures that any potential errors caused by the incorrect decoding of B slices are mitigated, leading to improved decoding performance and reduced error propagation in the output video.
