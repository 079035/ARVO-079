Vulnerability:
The vulnerability being patched in this diff file is a heap-buffer-overflow when reading input on a 32-bit architecture.

Summary of the fix:
The fix addresses the vulnerability by adding checks to ensure that there is enough input remaining to read the compressed size and compressed bytes. If there is not enough input, the function returns an error code (-1) indicating the failure.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The line `src += src_offset;` advances the `src` pointer by the `src_offset` value.
2. The line `srcsize -= src_offset;` updates the `srcsize` variable by subtracting the `src_offset` value.
3. The line `srcsize -= sizeof(int32_t);` subtracts the size of an `int32_t` from the `srcsize` variable.
4. The following check `if (srcsize < 0)` verifies if there is enough input remaining to read the compressed size, and if not, it returns an error code (-1).
5. The line `srcsize -= cbytes;` subtracts the value of `cbytes` (compressed bytes) from `srcsize`.
6. The following check `if (srcsize < 0)` verifies if there is enough input remaining to read the compressed bytes, and if not, it returns an error code (-1).
7. These checks ensure that there is enough input remaining in the buffer before reading the compressed size and compressed bytes, preventing heap-buffer-overflow errors.
