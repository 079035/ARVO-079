Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code is a memory leak. The code uses the `g_free` function to free memory in the `pinfo->private_table` hash table when using TCP. However, this hash table is created using `g_hash_table_new()` instead of `g_hash_table_new_full()` with a `g_free` function to properly release the memory.

Fix:
The fix for the vulnerability is to use the `g_hash_table_new_full()` function instead of `g_hash_table_new()` when creating the `pinfo->private_table` hash table. This ensures that the memory allocated for the hash table keys and values is properly freed.

Detailed Fix:

1. Find the following code block:
   ```
   if (pinfo->private_table == NULL && pinfo->ptype == PT_TCP) {
-      pinfo->private_table = g_hash_table_new_full(g_str_hash, g_str_equal,
-        g_free, g_free);
+      pinfo->private_table = g_hash_table_new(g_str_hash, g_str_equal);
     }
   ```

2. Replace it with the following code block:
   ```
   if (pinfo->private_table == NULL && pinfo->ptype == PT_TCP) {
+      pinfo->private_table = g_hash_table_new_full(g_str_hash, g_str_equal,
+        g_free, g_free);
     }
   ```

3. This change ensures that the `pinfo->private_table` hash table is created with the `g_hash_table_new_full()` function, providing the `g_free` function to properly release the memory for the keys and values.

4. Recompile the code to apply the fix.

By making this fix, the memory leak vulnerability is resolved, and the code will properly release the memory allocated for the hash table keys and values.
