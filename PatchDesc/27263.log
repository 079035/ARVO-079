Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is an incorrect calculation of the upper bound for gzip compression. The code incorrectly calculates the size of the output buffer by adding a constant value of 10 bytes for the header, 8 bytes for the footer, and an estimation of the maximum input expansion. This could lead to insufficient memory allocation and buffer overflow.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix in the patch file is to replace the incorrect calculation of the output buffer size with a call to the `compressBound` function from the miniz library. This function accurately calculates the upper bound for gzip compression and ensures memory safety.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
The previous code wrongly estimated the maximum input expansion by using the formula `((int)(in_len / 32000) + 1) * 5`. However, this formula does not always accurately account for the worst-case expansion of gzip compression. The fix replaces this estimation with a call to `compressBound(in_len)`, which is a function provided by the miniz library. This function calculates the maximum size needed to hold the compressed output based on the input length and guarantees memory safety.

By using `compressBound(in_len)` to calculate the output buffer size, the fix ensures that enough memory is allocated to hold the compressed data without risking buffer overflow. This improvement enhances the stability and security of the code.
