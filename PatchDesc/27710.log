Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that this patch fixes is a heap overflow in the `flb_signv4_uri_normalize_path` function.

Summary of Fix:
The fix involves properly handling the length of the output string `out` and adding a null terminator at the end.

Detailed Description of Fix:
1. The patch modifies the memory allocation for the `out` string by increasing its size by 1 (`len + 1`). This ensures that the buffer is large enough to accommodate the null terminator that will be added later.
2. The patch adds a null terminator to the `out` string by assigning `'\0'` to `out[len]`. This ensures that the string is properly terminated, preventing any potential heap overflow.
3. The patch also updates the logic for handling the trailing slash (`end_slash`) to correctly check if a slash should be added to the end of the normalized URI.
4. Additionally, the patch contains some code clean-up by removing unnecessary freeing of split entries (`flb_utils_split_free_entry`). This does not directly affect the vulnerability but improves the code readability and performance.

Overall, the fix addresses the heap overflow vulnerability by correctly handling the length of the output string and properly terminating it with a null character.
