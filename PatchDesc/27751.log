Vulnerability:
In the given diff file, the vulnerability that could be patched is a potential memory leak. The `out_buf` variable is allocated memory within the `flb_pack_json()` function, but it is not freed if the subsequent condition is met and the function returns without freeing it.

Summary of the fix:
The fix adds code to free the `out_buf` variable before the function returns in order to prevent the memory leak.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. Declare a new variable `size_t off` to hold the offset value.
2. Initialize a `msgpack_unpacked` structure named `result` to unpack the `out_buf` and obtain the root object.
3. Use the function `msgpack_unpack_next()` to unpack the `out_buf` and store the result in `result`, along with updating the offset value using the `off` variable.
4. Check if the unpacking was successful by comparing `ret2` with `MSGPACK_UNPACK_SUCCESS`.
5. If the unpacking was successful, obtain the root object from `result` using `result.data`.
6. Convert the root object to a JSON string using the `flb_msgpack_to_json_str()` function.
7. Free the `out_buf` variable using `free()` to prevent memory leaks.
8. The fix ensures that even if the condition `ret == 0` is met, the allocated memory for `out_buf` is properly freed before returning from the function.
