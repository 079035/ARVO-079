Vulnerability:
The vulnerability fixed in this code patch is a bad cast to `BarewordLiteral`. This vulnerability was discovered by oss-fuzz.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix corrects the type casting in the code to ensure that the correct types are used.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
- In the original code, there is a line that attempts to cast `glob_after` to `BarewordLiteral` using `static_cast<AST::BarewordLiteral*>(glob_after.ptr())`.
- However, the correct type for `glob_after` in this context is not `BarewordLiteral`, but `Glob`. This incorrect cast leads to a type mismatch.
- To fix this, the code patch corrects the cast to `Glob` using `static_cast<AST::Glob*>(glob_after.ptr())`, which ensures that the correct type is used.
- With this fix, the code correctly handles different types of nodes, such as `Glob`, `BarewordLiteral`, and `Tilde`, when constructing the `textbuilder` string.
