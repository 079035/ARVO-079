Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given code is a missing check on the variable `val` that can lead to an overflow.

Summary of the fix:
The fix adds a check to ensure that `val` is not negative. If `val` is negative, the function returns an error (`FLB_HTTP_ERROR`).

Detailed description of the fix:
In the function `process_chunked_data()`, after converting the hexa string to decimal and storing it in the variable `val`, the fix adds the following code:

```c
if (val < 0) {
    return FLB_HTTP_ERROR;
}
```

This check ensures that `val` is not negative. If `val` is negative, it means an invalid value was obtained from the hexa string, indicating a potential overflow. In such case, the function returns `FLB_HTTP_ERROR` to indicate that there is an error processing the chunked data.

This fix prevents the vulnerability by verifying the validity of the value before further processing, mitigating the risk of an overflow.
