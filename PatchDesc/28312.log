Vulnerability:
The vulnerability patched in this diff file is an out-of-bounds read/write vulnerability. Specifically, in the function `sas7bdat_parse_page_pass2`, there is a section of code that checks if the page type is `SAS_PAGE_TYPE_MIX` and performs some operations based on that. However, there is a missing check to ensure that the `shp` pointer does not exceed the page boundaries before accessing it.

Summary of the fix:
The fix in this patch improves the bounds checking in the `sas7bdat_parse_page_pass2` function.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The patch introduces a boundary check by verifying that `shp + 4` does not exceed the page size before accessing the memory at that location.
2. It also adds a check for the value stored at the `shp` location. The fix ensures that the value at the `shp` location is either `0x00000000` or `0x20202020` before proceeding. This check is performed to handle specific cases where the padding is not aligned to 8-byte boundaries in files created by Stat/Transfer.
3. If the conditions are met, the `data` pointer is set to `shp + 4` to skip the padding. Otherwise, the `data` pointer remains unchanged.
4. The subsequent code then proceeds to parse rows based on the `data` pointer.

This fix prevents out-of-bounds read/write by ensuring that the necessary boundaries are checked and only valid memory locations are accessed.
