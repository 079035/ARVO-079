Vulnerability: Out-of-bounds read in ChannelMaskBaseTlv::IsValid()

Summary of the fix: The fix addresses an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `ChannelMaskBaseTlv::IsValid()` function.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. In the original code, the `IsValid()` function iterates over a list of `ChannelMaskEntryBase` objects until it reaches the end of the list. However, the condition for the while loop, `reinterpret_cast<const uint8_t *>(entry) < end`, does not check if there is enough space in memory to read the entire `ChannelMaskEntryBase` object.
2. The fix modifies the condition to `reinterpret_cast<const uint8_t *>(entry) + sizeof(ChannelMaskEntryBase) <= end`, which ensures that there is enough space in memory to read the complete `ChannelMaskEntryBase` object.
3. This change guarantees that the iterator does not go beyond the bounds of the memory allocated for the list of `ChannelMaskEntryBase` objects, preventing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
4. The fix also initializes the `ret` variable to `false` at the beginning of the function for clarity and readability.
5. The `VerifyOrExit()` macro is used to check the validity of `entry` and to ensure that it is within the specified memory range.
