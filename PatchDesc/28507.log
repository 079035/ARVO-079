Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code is a heap use-after-free. When the CIL compiler fails to compile a specific policy, it attempts to destroy its database. However, this leads to a heap use-after-free issue because the validatetrans AST object references a stack variable that is local to the __cil_fill_constraint_leaf_expr function.

Fix Summary:
The fix for this vulnerability involves dropping the '&' sign when adding the list, which allows the list to be added correctly.

Detailed Fix Description:
In the given diff file, the fix is made in the cil_build_ast.c file. The problematic code is as follows:

```c
cil_list_append(*leaf_expr, CIL_LIST, &sub_list);
```

To fix the vulnerability, the fix simply removes the '&' sign from the `cil_list_append` statement. The corrected code is as follows:

```c
cil_list_append(*leaf_expr, CIL_LIST, sub_list);
```

By making this change, the list is properly added without referring to the stack variable, eliminating the heap use-after-free vulnerability.
