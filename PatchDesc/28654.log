Vulnerability:
The vulnerability patched in this diff file is a null-dereference read in the CIL compiler. The issue occurs when trying to compile a policy containing the following syntax:

```
(optional o (validatetrans x (eq t3 (a ()))))
```

When attempting to compile this policy, the CIL compiler reports an "Invalid syntax" error but continues the compilation process.

Summary of the fix:
The fix for this vulnerability is to stop the compilation when the `cil_fill_list()` function reports an error. 

Detailed description of the fix:
In the code before the fix, the `cil_fill_list()` function is called to fill a list with elements from the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). If `cil_fill_list()` encounters an error, it returns a non-zero value. However, the code does not handle this error and continues the compilation process.

In the patched code, the return value of `cil_fill_list()` is checked. If the return value indicates an error (`rc != SEPOL_OK`), the code destroys the list that was being filled (`cil_list_destroy()`) and exits the function. This ensures that the compilation process is stopped when an error occurs during the filling of the list.
