Vulnerability: Allowing Extended TLVs in the Operational Dataset

Summary of the Fix: The fix prevents the code from allowing Extended TLVs in the Operational Dataset.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
1. The code snippet is from the file `dataset.cpp` in the `src/core/meshcop` directory.
2. The vulnerability being fixed is related to Extended TLVs in the Operational Dataset.
3. In the `IsValid()` function, a loop iterates through the TLVs in the dataset.
4. Previously, the code did not check if the TLV was an Extended TLV, which could potentially cause issues.
5. The fix adds a check to ensure that the current TLV is not an Extended TLV before performing further checks.
6. The line `VerifyOrExit(!cur->IsExtended() && (cur + 1) <= end && cur->GetNext() <= end && Tlv::IsValid(*cur), rval = false);` implements the fix.
   1. `!cur->IsExtended()` checks if the TLV is not an Extended TLV.
   2. `(cur + 1) <= end` ensures that the next TLV is within the dataset boundaries.
   3. `cur->GetNext() <= end` also ensures the next TLV is within the dataset boundaries.
   4. `Tlv::IsValid(*cur)` performs additional validity checks on the TLV.
   5. If any of these conditions fail, `rval` is set to `false`.
7. The fix ensures that only valid TLVs are considered in the dataset by excluding Extended TLVs.
