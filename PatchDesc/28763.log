Vulnerability: Missing information about the AVIF image format in the README.md file.

Summary of the fix: The fix adds the AV1 Image File Format (AVIF) to the list of image formats with read and write support in the README.md file.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. Previously, the README.md file listed the image formats with read and write support but did not include AVIF.
2. The commit made by Carl Schwan adds a new bullet point with the text "AV1 Image File Format (AVIF)" to the list of supported formats.
3. This change ensures that users are aware that the AVIF format is supported by the code.
