Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that could be patched in the given diff file is the missing addition of the AV1 Image File Format (AVIF) to the list of supported formats.

Summary of the fix:
The fix adds support for AV1 Image File Format (AVIF) in the list of image formats with read and write support.

Detailed description of the fix:
The fix in the diff file modifies the README.md file. Specifically, it adds an entry for AV1 Image File Format (AVIF) to the list of image formats with read and write support. Previously, AVIF was not included in the list.

This change allows the code or project to support AVIF as a valid image format for read and write operations. AVIF is a relatively new image format that offers efficient compression and high image quality, so adding support for it expands the capabilities of the code or project.

Additionally, the diff file also includes other image formats that have read and write support, such as Encapsulated PostScript (eps), Personal Computer Exchange (pcx), SGI images (rgb, rgba, sgi, bw), Softimage PIC (pic), Targa (tga), and XView (xv).

By including AVIF in the list of supported formats, users or developers can now work with AVIF images using the code or project.
