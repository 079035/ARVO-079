Vulnerability: Buffer Overflow

Summary of fix: The fix adds a check to ensure that the `map_sz` parameter is greater than or equal to 5 before performing any operations using it.

Detailed description of fix: In the given code, there is a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The function `mdb_map_find_next0` takes a `map_sz` parameter, which specifies the size of the `map` buffer. However, there is no check to ensure that `map_sz` is valid and greater than or equal to the expected minimum size.

The fix addresses this vulnerability by adding a check at the beginning of the function to verify if `map_sz` is less than 5. If `map_sz` is less than 5, the function returns early, indicating that there are no pages to be found.

By performing this check, the fix ensures that further operations in the function that rely on `map_sz` being a valid size do not cause a buffer overflow.
