1. Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code was related to the buffer size for the Server Name Indication (SNI) hostname in the SSL protocol structure. The buffer size was initially set to 64 bytes, which was insufficient as per RFC 4366, which states that SNI hostnames can be up to 255 bytes long. This could lead to failed application matches due to truncation of the hostname.

2. Short Summary of the Fix:
The fix for this vulnerability was to increase the buffer size for the SNI hostname from 64 bytes to 256 bytes. This change ensures that the buffer can accommodate the maximum length of an SNI hostname as per RFC 4366.

3. Detailed Description of the Fix:
The fix was implemented in the `ndpi_flow_struct` structure, specifically in the `ssl` structure within the `protos` union. The `client_requested_server_name` array, which holds the SNI hostname, was initially declared with a size of 64 bytes. This was increased to 256 bytes in the fix. The comment was also updated to reflect this change and to mention the relevant RFC 4366. This change ensures that the `client_requested_server_name` array can hold SNI hostnames of up to 255 bytes, preventing truncation and the associated application match failures.
