Vulnerability:

The vulnerability that could be patched in this diff file is an unknown-read when reading the stream if the previous stream compressed bytes (cbytes) is less than 0. This vulnerability can lead to incorrect reading and decompression of compressed data.

Summary of Fix:

The fix addresses the issue by properly handling the negative cbytes value when it is encountered. It makes sure that the compressed data is not misinterpreted and correctly decompressed.

Detailed Description of Fix:

1. Prior to the fix, if the cbytes value is negative, indicating an encoding depending on the token, the code does not properly handle it. It assumes that everything is encoded in the cbytes token and overwrites the value of nbytes with neblock, which is incorrect.

2. The fix modifies the code to first update the value of nbytes with neblock and then sets the cbytes value to 0. This ensures that the correct number of decompressed bytes is assigned to nbytes and that the negative cbytes value does not affect the decompression process.

3. This fix resolves the vulnerability by preventing the misinterpretation of compressed data and ensuring proper decompression of the data.
