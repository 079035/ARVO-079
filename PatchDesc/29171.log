Vulnerability Description:
In the given diff file, the vulnerability that has been patched is an ASAN (AddressSanitizer) unknown-read when reading the stream. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to access uninitialized or invalid memory, leading to potential crashes or information leaks.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix for this vulnerability involves modifying the code in the blosc_d() function to correctly handle the negative value of "cbytes" and update the values of "nbytes" and "cbytes" accordingly.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
1. In the original code, when "cbytes" is negative, indicating some encoding depending on the next token, the code mistakenly sets "nbytes" to "neblock" and sets "cbytes" to 0, assuming that everything is encoded in the "cbytes" token. This is incorrect and could lead to an ASAN unknown-read vulnerability.

2. The fix involves updating the code to correctly set "nbytes" to "neblock" and leave "cbytes" unchanged when "cbytes" is negative. This ensures that the correct number of uncompressed bytes is assigned to "nbytes" and avoids accessing uninitialized or invalid memory.

Updated code snippet showing the fix:

```c
if (cbytes < 0) {
  uint8_t token;

  if (srcsize < (signed)sizeof(uint8_t)) {
    // Not enough input to read token
    return -1;
  }
  srcsize -= sizeof(uint8_t);

  token = src[0];
  src += 1;
  ctbytes += 1;

  if (token & 0x1) {
    // A run of bytes that are different than 0
    if (cbytes < -255) {
      // Runs can only encode a byte
      return -2;
    }
    uint8_t value = -cbytes;
    memset(_dest, value, (unsigned int) neblock);
    nbytes = neblock;
    cbytes = 0;  // everything is encoded in the cbytes token
  }
  else {
    nbytes = neblock;
    // cbytes remains unchanged to handle other encoding possibilities
  }
}
```

With this fix, the vulnerability is patched, and the code can safely handle the negative value of "cbytes" without introducing any security risks.
