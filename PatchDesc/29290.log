Vulnerability:
The vulnerability patched in this diff file is related to a potential buffer overflow. In the code, there is a cast from a QByteArray to quint32_le, but the size of the QByteArray is not verified before the cast is performed. This can lead to undefined behavior and potentially allow an attacker to overwrite memory.

Summary of the fix:
The fix ensures that the size of the QByteArray, `riffSizeData`, is checked before performing the cast to quint32_le. If the size of `riffSizeData` is not equal to the size of quint32_le, the function returns false and the vulnerability is prevented.

Detailed description of the fix:
The fix adds a check to verify the size of `riffSizeData` using the `size()` function. If the size is not equal to `sizeof(quint32_le)`, the function returns false and exits, indicating that the file is invalid. This prevents the subsequent cast to `quint32_le` from happening if the buffer size is incorrect. By performing this check, the risk of a buffer overflow and potential memory corruption is mitigated.
