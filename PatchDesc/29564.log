Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code is a heap-buffer-overflow issue in the function `fio_keyword_replace()` in the `options.c` file. This vulnerability was discovered by Google's OSS-fuzz when substituting keywords in job files. It can be triggered by compiling fio with address sanitizer options and running a specific job file.

Summary of the fix:
The fix for this vulnerability involves correcting a thinko and rearranging some code to make it clearer that the `olen` variable is being used as an initial offset. This fix prevents the heap-buffer-overflow issue from occurring.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The problematic line that caused the heap-buffer-overflow issue is `opt += olen + strlen(kw->word);`. The fix modifies this line to `opt += olen + strlen(kw->replace);`. This change corrects the thinko and ensures that the correct length is added to `opt`.

2. Additionally, the code is rearranged to make it clearer that the `olen` variable is used as an initial offset. The fixed code now calculates the length of the opt string (`len`) before copying the original string (if present) to the new string. This ensures that the correct length is used for memory allocation and copying.

3. The fix also includes freeing the old `opt` string after replacing it with the new string.

These modifications prevent the heap-buffer-overflow issue from occurring when substituting keywords in job files and resolve the vulnerability.
