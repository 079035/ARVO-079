Vulnerability: Move-assigning from itself in the KResultOr class.

Summary of the Fix: The fix ensures that if the move-assignment operator is called with the same object as the source and target, no action is taken.

Detailed Description of the Fix: In the given diff file, the vulnerability being patched is move-assigning from itself in the KResultOr class. The issue arises in the `KResultOr& operator=(KResultOr&& other)` function. 

Before the fix, this function did not check if the source object (`other`) is the same as the target object (`this`). As a result, when move-assigning from itself, the function would behave incorrectly and lead to undefined behavior.

To fix this issue, the code has been modified to include a check at the beginning of the `operator=` function. If the `other` object is the same as the `this` object, the function directly returns `*this` without performing any operations.

This fix ensures that when move-assigning from itself, the `operator=` function won't modify the state of the object and will avoid any potential undefined behavior.
