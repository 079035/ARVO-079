Vulnerability: Move-assigning from itself

Summary of the fix: Avoid move-assigning from itself by checking if the object being moved is the same as the current object.

Detailed description of the fix: In the given code, the move assignment operator (`operator=()`) for the `KResultOr` class does not check if the object being moved from (`other`) is the same as the current object (`this`). This can lead to a move-assigning operation from itself, resulting in undefined behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, the code has been modified to include a check at the beginning of the move assignment operator. The check compares the addresses of `other` and `this`. If they are equal, indicating that the object is being move-assigned from itself, the function returns early without performing any further operations.

This fix ensures that the move-assignment operation doesn't happen if the object is being moved from itself.
