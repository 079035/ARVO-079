Vulnerability:
This diff file patches a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `AppendUintOption` function in the `coap_message.cpp` file.

Summary of the fix:
The fix addresses a buffer overflow issue in the `AppendUintOption` function by adding additional checks to prevent accessing memory beyond the allocated buffer.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the original code, there was a risk of buffer overflow in the `AppendUintOption` function. The function takes an unsigned 32-bit integer value `aValue` and appends it as an option to a CoAP message. To accomplish this, the function first writes the 32-bit value into a buffer using the `Encoding::BigEndian::WriteUint32` function. Then, it checks for leading zeroes in the buffer and adjusts the `value` and `length` variables accordingly. However, this check was flawed and could lead to accessing memory beyond the allocated buffer.

The fix in this diff file modifies the while loop condition to correctly ensure both the `length` is greater than 0 and the `value[0]` is equal to 0. This ensures that the loop does not access memory beyond the allocated buffer. By making this adjustment, the buffer overflow vulnerability is mitigated, and the function no longer risks accessing memory in an unintended way.

Overall, the fix strengthens the input validation and bounds checking in the `AppendUintOption` function to prevent the buffer overflow and improve the security and reliability of the CoAP message handling.
