Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that was patched in the given diff file is an unknown read vulnerability when `content_len` is less than 0 in the function `frame_get_vlmetalayers` in the file `frame.c`.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix in this patch prevents the reading of `content_len` when it is less than 0. If `content_len` is less than 0, the function `frame_get_vlmetalayers` returns an `BLOSC2_ERROR_DATA` error, indicating a data error.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
In the given code, after reading the size of the content in the `frame_get_vlmetalayers` function, a check is added to validate the value of `content_len` using the condition `if (content_len < 0)`. If `content_len` is less than 0, indicating a negative value, the function returns `BLOSC2_ERROR_DATA`, which indicates a data error. This prevents the subsequent execution of code that relies on `content_len` being a valid non-negative value. This fix ensures that negative values for `content_len` are not used and avoids potential undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities.
