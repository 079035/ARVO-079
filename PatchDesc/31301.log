Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code is that the `fnv_32a_buf` function does not handle zero-length buffers correctly. If the length of the buffer passed to the function is zero, it does not return the correct hash value and may result in a crash.

Summary of Fix:
The fix addresses the crash on empty strings by adding a check to return the provided hash value if the length of the buffer is zero.

Detailed Fix Description:
1. The fix begins by adding a check for the length of the buffer (`len`) at the start of the `fnv_32a_buf` function. If `len` is zero, it means the buffer is empty, so the function immediately returns the provided hash value (`hval`).
2. If the length is not zero, the function continues with the existing code logic to calculate the hash value for the buffer.
3. The existing code uses a switch statement and a loop to calculate the hash value based on the bytes in the buffer. This logic remains unchanged.
4. After the loop completes, the function returns the calculated hash value as before.

This fix ensures that when an empty string is passed as the buffer, the function returns the correct hash value without causing a crash.
