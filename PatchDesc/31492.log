Vulnerability:
The vulnerability being patched in this diff file is that the `.cache` directory was not being ignored by git.

Summary of Fix:
The fix involves adding the `.cache` directory to the `.gitignore` file, so that it is ignored by git.

Detailed Description of Fix:
The fix is implemented by modifying the `.gitignore` file. In this file, certain files and directories are listed that should be ignored by git and not tracked. The diff file shows the changes made to the `.gitignore` file to patch the vulnerability.

The diff file shows that the addition of the line `+.cache` was made to the `.gitignore` file. This means that the `.cache` directory will now be ignored by git. Any files or subdirectories within the `.cache` directory will not be tracked by git and will not be included in git commits.

By ignoring the `.cache` directory, unnecessary or temporary files that are stored in this directory will not be included in the git repository. This helps to keep the repository clean and avoids unnecessary tracking of files that are generated or changed frequently during the development process.

Ignoring the `.cache` directory is a common practice to prevent accidental inclusion of temporary or generated files in the repository. This fix ensures that the `.cache` directory is appropriately ignored by git, mitigating the vulnerability.
