Vulnerability:
ASAN heap-buffer-overflow when reading chunk offset in the frame.

Summary of the fix:
The fix addresses a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability that occurs when reading the chunk offset in the frame.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the given diff file, the fix involves modifying the code in the `get_coffsets` function. The vulnerability is addressed by adding a check to ensure that the value of `*off_cbytes` does not exceed the frame boundary.

Before the fix, if the value of `*off_cbytes` was greater than the frame length, it could lead to a heap-buffer-overflow. This vulnerability is fixed by checking if `*off_cbytes` is less than 0 or if adding it to the `off_pos` exceeds the frame length. If either of these conditions is true, an error is thrown, and the function returns NULL.

By implementing this fix, the code prevents accessing offsets outside the frame boundary, thus eliminating the heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability.

Overall, the fix ensures that the code reads offsets within the frame's boundary, preventing any potential heap-buffer-overflow vulnerabilities.
