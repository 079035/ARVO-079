Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that is patched in this diff file is a crash in the function `pcl::PLYReader::amendProperty()`. 

Summary of fix:
The fix adds a check to handle the case when the `finder` iterator is invalid (equal to `cloud_->fields.rend()`).

Detailed description of fix:
1. The diff file shows changes made to the `pcl::PLYReader::amendProperty()` function in the `ply_io.cpp` file.
2. Prior to the fix, the function had the following code:
```cpp
auto finder = cloud_->fields.rbegin();
for (; finder != cloud_->fields.rend(); ++finder)
    if (finder->name == old_name)
        break;
assert(finder != cloud_->fields.rend());
```
3. In the original code, the `finder` iterator is used to search for a field in `cloud_->fields` with a given `old_name`. If the iterator is equal to `cloud_->fields.rend()`, it means that the field was not found.
4. The fix modifies the code to handle the case when the `finder` iterator is invalid. It adds the following code block:
```cpp
if (finder == cloud_->fields.rend())
{
    PCL_ERROR("[pcl::PLYReader::amendProperty] old_name '%s' was not found in cloud_->fields!\n",
              old_name.c_str());
    assert(false);
    return;
}
```
5. In the modified code, if the `finder` iterator is equal to `cloud_->fields.rend()`, it means that the field was not found. The code logs an error message using `PCL_ERROR()` and then asserts false to indicate an unexpected condition. The `return` statement is added to exit the function.
6. This fix prevents invalid memory reads and crashes that can occur when the `finder` iterator is invalid.

Overall, the fix adds an error handling mechanism to gracefully handle the case when the desired field is not found, preventing crashes and potential memory issues.
