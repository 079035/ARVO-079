Vulnerability:
The vulnerability patched in the given diff file is that the code does not handle the case when a child box is larger than its container box. It only logs a warning message, but does not take any further action.

Fix Summary:
The fix adds a check for the "no-check" flag in the "core" options. If the flag is not set, it deletes the child box and returns an error code indicating an invalid file.

Detailed Fix Description:
1. The code initially checks if the size of the child box is greater than the size of the parent container box.
2. If the size of the child box is larger, it proceeds with the following actions:
   - Logs a warning message indicating that the child box is larger than the container box.
   - Checks if the "no-check" flag is set in the "core" options.
     - If the flag is set, the code continues without any further action.
     - If the flag is not set, it performs the following steps:
       - Deletes the child box by calling the "gf_isom_box_del" function.
       - Returns an error code "GF_ISOM_INVALID_FILE" to indicate that the file is invalid.
3. This fix ensures that if the child box is larger than the container box and the "no-check" flag is not set, the child box is deleted and an error is returned, indicating an invalid file.
