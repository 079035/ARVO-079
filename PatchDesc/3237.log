Vulnerability:
The diff file is fixing vulnerability #59. The vulnerability involves troublesome macros hiding the parser struct membership and dereferencing that pointer.

Summary of Fix:
The fix addresses the issue of macros hiding parser struct membership and dereferences the pointer to resolve the vulnerability.

Detailed Description of Fix:
The fix involves modifying the macros that were causing the vulnerability. The macros were hiding the membership of the parser struct and therefore creating issues when dereferencing the pointer. By resolving these troublesome macros, the vulnerability is patched.

The detailed changes made in the fix are not provided in the given diff file. However, it can be inferred that the macros causing the vulnerability have been modified or replaced in a way that the parser struct membership is no longer hidden. This ensures that the pointer is correctly dereferenced, eliminating the vulnerability.

The fix is committed in the git repository with the commit hash `56b64ca0406d31f0a8cd93e155c38a3b30b002f8`.
