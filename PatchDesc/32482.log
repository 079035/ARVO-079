Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that could be patched in the given diff file is a potential uninitialized memory read in the function `lxc_safe_int64_residual()`.

Summary of the fix:
The fix ensures that the buffer `residual` is always initialized by adding a `memset()` call before it is used.

Detailed description of the fix:
To fix the vulnerability, the following changes were made in the code:

1. A `memset(residual, 0, residual_len);` call was added before the check for `residual` and `residual_len`. The `memset()` call initializes the buffer `residual` with null bytes.

```diff
 if (residual && residual_len == 0)
     return ret_errno(EINVAL);
 
 if (!residual && residual_len != 0)
     return ret_errno(EINVAL);
 
+memset(residual, 0, residual_len);
```

This ensures that the `residual` buffer is always properly initialized before it is used.

The fix addresses the potential uninitialized memory read issue by ensuring that the buffer `residual` is properly initialized with null bytes before being used. This prevents any potential information leaks or undefined behavior that could occur if the buffer was left uninitialized.
