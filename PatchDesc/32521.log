Vulnerability: The vulnerability patched in this diff file is related to an issue with parsing real-time signals in the `rt_sig_num` function of the `confile_utils.c` file.

Summary of Fix: The fix addresses the vulnerability by adding appropriate checks and error handling to ensure that the parsing of real-time signals is done correctly.

Detailed Description of Fix:
1. The `rt_sig_num` function previously had a variable `rtmax` initialized to 0. It is now replaced with a boolean variable named `rtmax`.

2. An additional check is added to verify if the `signame` passed to `rt_sig_num` is an empty string. If it is, an error with the code `EINVAL` is returned.

3. The code checks if the `signame` starts with the string `"max-"`. If it does, the `rtmax` variable is set to `true` and the `signame` is updated to exclude the `"max-"` prefix. Similarly, if the `signame` starts with the string `"min+"`, the `rtmax` variable is set to `false` and the `signame` is updated to exclude the `"min+"` prefix. If the `signame` doesn't match either of these patterns, an error with the code `EINVAL` is returned.

4. The code then checks if the `signame` is an empty string or the first character is not a digit. If either condition is true, an error with the code `EINVAL` is returned.

5. If the `signame` is a valid digit, the `sig_num` function is called to get the signal number corresponding to the `signame`. Otherwise, if the `signame` starts with the string `"sig"`, the code checks if it is followed by the string `"rt"`. If it is, the `rt_sig_num` function is called with the modified `signame` to get the signal number.

6. Finally, the code checks if the obtained signal number `sig_n` is within the range of real-time signals (`SIGRTMIN` to `SIGRTMAX`). If it is outside this range, an error with the code `EINVAL` is returned.

7. The fixed code now correctly parses real-time signals and handles errors appropriately.

Note: The code snippets include some helper functions (such as `is_empty_string`, `ret_errno`, and `sig_num`) and data structures (such as `signames`) that are not shown in the provided diff file. However, they are assumed to be present and functioning correctly based on the context of the code.
