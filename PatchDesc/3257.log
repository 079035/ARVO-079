Vulnerability: 
The vulnerability in the code is that the upward prediction in the last block of pixels is not handled correctly. The code assumes that the line size is guaranteed to be a multiple of 16, but this is not the case. Therefore, when the last block of pixels is being processed, if the width is not a multiple of 16, the code throws a "Raw corrupt" exception. This can lead to a crash or unexpected behavior of the program.

Fix Summary:
The fix addresses the issue by checking if the current block is the last block of pixels before performing the upward prediction. If it is the last block, instead of throwing an exception, the code should handle the situation gracefully.

Detailed Fix Explanation:
1. In the code, add a check to see if `x + 16 >= width`, indicating that the current block is the last block of pixels.
2. If the above condition is true, modify the code to handle the situation gracefully instead of throwing an exception.
3. It is up to the developer to decide how to handle the last block in the upward prediction. One possible approach could be to ignore the upward prediction for the last block and set the predicted values to a default or some other sensible value.
4. Implement the chosen approach to handle the last block in the upward prediction properly, ensuring that the program does not crash or exhibit unexpected behavior.
5. Test the modified code thoroughly to ensure that the fix works as expected and does not introduce any regressions.
