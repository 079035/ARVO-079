Vulnerability:
Buffer overflow

Summary of the Fix:
Add length checks to prevent buffer overflow.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
In the given code, the vulnerability lies in the `HandleCommissioningSet` function of the `Leader` class in the `network_data_leader_ftd.cpp` file. In this function, a buffer named `tlvs` is used to store some data. However, the length of the data read from the `aMessage` object is not properly checked, which could result in a buffer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the following changes have been made:
1. The variable `length` has been changed from `uint8_t` to `uint16_t` to accommodate larger sizes.
2. Before reading the data into the `tlvs` buffer, a check has been added to ensure that the length of the data is not greater than the size of the `tlvs` buffer. This prevents buffer overflow.
3. The loop that iterates over the MeshCoP TLVs has been modified to properly handle the length of the TLVs and prevent buffer overflow.
4. The call to the `SetCommissioningData` function has been updated to pass the correct length of the `tlvs` buffer.

These changes ensure that the length of the data is properly checked and prevent buffer overflow in the `HandleCommissioningSet` function.
