Vulnerability: Uninitialized member of the rescale[] array could be accessed in the functions get_gray_rgb_row() or get_gray_cmyk_row() in the rdppm.c file.

Summary of Fix: The fix ensures that the unused members of the rescale[] array are initialized.

Detailed Description of Fix: The fix includes initializing the unused members of the rescale[] array in the rdppm.c file. This prevents uninitialized access to these members in the functions get_gray_rgb_row() and get_gray_cmyk_row(). The uninitialized access could occur when processing a specific fuzzing test case, which was a 1-pixel PGM file with a maximum value of 1 and an actual value of 8. Since the get_gray_rgb_row() and get_gray_cmyk_row() functions do not perform bounds checking on the PPM values for performance reasons, it becomes necessary to initialize the unused members of the rescale[] array to prevent any undefined behavior. The fix first allocates space for the rescale[] array using the allocated memory function. Then, it uses the MEMZERO macro to initialize the allocated memory to zero. Finally, it computes and assigns values to the rescale[] array by iterating over the range of valid values and applying the necessary calculation. By initializing the unused members of the rescale[] array, the fix ensures that the code is robust and does not encounter uninitialized access issues in the given context.
