Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that could be patched in the provided diff file is an out-of-bounds read in the `FileSystemFilter::Cleanup` function. The vulnerability is fixed in this commit to address the bug reported in the Chromium project.

Summary of the fix:
The fix in this commit addresses an out-of-bounds read issue in the `FileSystemFilter::Cleanup` function by checking for the remaining distance before accessing the characters in the input string.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The `Cleanup` function starts by checking if the input string `in` is empty. If it is empty, the function returns, indicating that no cleanup is required.
2. Next, the function removes any leading spaces in the input string. It iterates over the characters of the string and removes any spaces at the beginning of the path.
3. The function then defines the separator character based on the operating system.
4. The main part of the fix involves addressing the out-of-bounds read issue. Before performing any operations on the characters, the function calculates the remaining distance between the current iterator position and the end of the input string using the `std::distance` function.
5. The fix introduces conditions to check if there are enough remaining characters in the string to safely access certain sequences. For example, it checks if there are at least 3 characters remaining to safely compare the characters with "://". Similarly, it checks if there are at least 2 characters remaining to compare with "\\\\".
6. By adding these conditions, the fix ensures that the code avoids accessing characters beyond the end of the string, thereby preventing the out-of-bounds read issue.
7. The rest of the function performs the cleanup of path delimiters and handles hex sequences in URIs, but these parts are not directly related to fixing the out-of-bounds read issue.
