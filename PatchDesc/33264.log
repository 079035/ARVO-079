Vulnerability:
The vulnerability patched in this diff file is that there is a possible buffer overflow when calculating the stop value in the `_blosc_getitem` function. If the calculated `stop` value exceeds the bounds of the source buffer, it could result in accessing memory beyond what is allocated for the buffer, leading to undefined behavior and potential security issues.

Summary of the fix:
The fix adds bounds checks for the `start` and `stop` values to ensure they do not exceed the boundaries of the source buffer. If either value is out of bounds, an error is returned.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. Introduced two bound checks for the `start` and `stop` values to ensure they do not exceed the boundaries of the source buffer.
2. The first check `(start < 0) || (start * header->typesize > header->nbytes)` verifies if `start` is negative or if the calculated start index exceeds the size of the source buffer. If the check fails, an error is returned.
3. The second check `(stop < 0) || (stop * header->typesize > header->nbytes)` verifies if `stop` is negative or if the calculated stop index exceeds the size of the source buffer. If the check fails, an error is returned.
4. This fix ensures that the `start` and `stop` values are within the bounds of the source buffer before proceeding with the decompression operation, preventing buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
