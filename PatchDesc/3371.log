Vulnerability: The vulnerability that has been patched in this diff file is an unexpected value for the `bitPerPixel` variable. The code allowed values of `bitPerPixel` other than 12 or 14, which could potentially lead to incorrect decoding of the raw image data.

Summary of the Fix: The fix ensures that only `bitPerPixel` values of 12 or 14 are allowed. Any other value will throw an exception, preventing incorrect decoding.

Detailed Description of the Fix: 

1. The fix adds a switch statement that checks the value of `bitPerPixel`:

   ```cpp
   switch (bitPerPixel) {
   case 12:
   case 14:
     break;
   default:
     ThrowRDE("Unexpected bits per pixel: %u.", bitPerPixel);
   };
   ```

2. If the value of `bitPerPixel` is 12 or 14, the code does nothing and continues execution.

3. If the value of `bitPerPixel` is not 12 or 14, an exception is thrown with a message indicating the unexpected value.

This fix ensures that only valid values of `bitPerPixel` are allowed, preventing incorrect decoding of the raw image data.
