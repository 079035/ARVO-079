Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in this code is that the length of the `aArgs` array is not properly checked before accessing its elements in the `for` loop. This results in potential out-of-bounds memory access if the `aArgsLength` is less than 2.

Summary of the fix:
The fix in this commit ensures that the length of the `aArgs` array is at least 2 before accessing its elements in the `for` loop by changing the checking condition from `aArgsLength >= 1` to `aArgsLength >= 2`.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the original code, the `VerifyOrExit` macro is used to check that the `aArgsLength` is at least 1 before accessing `aArgs[1]` in the `for` loop. However, this is incorrect because accessing `aArgs[1]` requires the length to be at least 2.

The fix in this commit changes the checking condition of `VerifyOrExit` to `aArgsLength >= 2`, ensuring that the length of `aArgs` is properly checked before entering the loop.

This fix prevents potential out-of-bounds memory access by making sure that the loop is only entered when there are at least 2 elements in the `aArgs` array.
