Vulnerability:
The vulnerability patched in the given diff file is that the `demux_NewAdvanced` function did not check if the `url` parameter contains `://` as a required prefix. Without the `://` prefix, creating the demux would not work, resulting in an error. The vulnerability allowed for the creation of a demux with an invalid URL.

Summary of the fix:
The fix in the diff file requires the `url` parameter to contain `://` as a prefix. If the `url` does not contain `://`, the fix sets `errno` to `EINVAL` (invalid argument) and returns `NULL`, indicating an error.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The `demux_NewAdvanced` function now checks if the `url` parameter contains `://` by using the `strstr` function to search for `://` in the `url`. If `p` (the pointer returned by `strstr`) is `NULL`, it means that `://` is not present in the `url`.
2. If `p` is `NULL`, indicating that `://` is not present, `errno` is set to `EINVAL` to indicate that the argument is invalid.
3. Finally, if `p` is `NULL`, the function returns `NULL`, indicating an error.
4. Otherwise, if `p` is not `NULL`, the function proceeds with creating the demux as before, using the `url` parameter.

Overall, the fix ensures that the `url` parameter of the `demux_NewAdvanced` function contains `://` as a required prefix, preventing the creation of a demux with an invalid URL.
