Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is that the `demux_NewAdvanced` function does not check if the `url` parameter contains "://" before using it. If the string "://" is not present in the `url`, an invalid demux will be created, leading to undefined behavior.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix requires adding a check to ensure that the `url` parameter contains "://". If it does not, the function should set the `errno` to `EINVAL` and return `NULL`.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
To fix the vulnerability, the following changes can be made to the code:
1. Add the following code snippet before creating the demux:
```c
const char *p = strstr(url, "://");
if (p == NULL) {
    errno = EINVAL;
    return NULL;
}
```
2. Replace the existing code that sets `p_demux->psz_location` with the following code:
```c
p_demux->psz_location = p_demux->psz_url + 3 + (p - url);
```
This change calculates the correct starting position of `psz_location` based on the position of "://" in the `url`.

These changes ensure that an error is returned if the `url` does not contain "://", avoiding the creation of an invalid demux.
