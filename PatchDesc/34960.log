Vulnerability:
Double-free vulnerability in the `parser_conf_file()` function in `flb_parser.c`.

Summary of the fix:
The vulnerability was fixed by removing the line `mk_rconf_free(fconf)` at the end of the function.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the vulnerable code, there is an incorrect memory deallocation that leads to a double-free vulnerability. The function `parser_conf_file()` reads and parses sections from a configuration file, and for each [PARSER] section, it creates a parser context.

In the original code, the `fconf` structure, which represents the parsed configuration file, is freed right before returning from the function using the `mk_rconf_free()` function. However, there are still references to strings allocated within the `fconf` structure that are being used after the call to `mk_rconf_free()`.

By removing the line `mk_rconf_free(fconf)`, the vulnerable double-free issue is fixed. Now, the `fconf` structure and its associated memory are not freed, allowing the referenced strings to remain valid for later use in the code.
