Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is that when the source size is 2^n + 1, the window size could end up being too small.

Summary of the fix:
The fix for this vulnerability is to remove the line `srcSize -= 1;` in the `else if` statement.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the `ZSTD_adjustCParams_internal` function, the code tries to optimize the compression parameters based on the given input source size and dictionary size. However, there is a bug in the code where if the source size is unknown (`srcSize == 0`), the code erroneously subtracts 1 from the `srcSize`.

The fixed code removes the line `srcSize -= 1;` in the `else if` statement, ensuring that if the source size is unknown, it is not modified. This prevents the window size from becoming too small when the source size is 2^n + 1.
