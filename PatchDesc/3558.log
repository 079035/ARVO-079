Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that could be patched in this diff file is an incorrect function call in the `reorder_marks_arabic` function. The incorrect function call is `buffer->merge_out_clusters(start, j)`.

Summary of the fix:
The fix involves replacing the incorrect function call `buffer->merge_out_clusters(start, j)` with the correct function call `buffer->merge_clusters(start, j)`.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. Previously, the code called `buffer->merge_out_clusters(start, j)` to merge clusters in the buffer. However, this is an incorrect function call.
2. The fix replaces the incorrect function call with the correct function call `buffer->merge_clusters(start, j)` to merge clusters in the buffer.
3. Additionally, the code uses the `memmove` function to move the glyph information between different positions in the buffer to correctly reorder the clusters.
4. After the fix, the clusters are correctly merged and reordered, ensuring that the function operates as intended.
