Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code is that the function `buffer->merge_out_clusters` is being called, which is incorrect. This function does not exist and therefore leads to a compilation error or undefined behavior.

Summary of the fix:
The fix removes the incorrect function `merge_out_clusters`, and replaces it with the correct function `merge_clusters`.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the given code, the function `buffer->merge_out_clusters` is used to merge clusters of glyphs. However, this function does not exist in the codebase, which means it would result in a compilation error or undefined behavior.

To fix this, the correct function `buffer->merge_clusters` is used instead. This function merges clusters of glyphs, which is the intended behavior of the code. The function call is updated to `buffer->merge_clusters(start, j)`.

Additionally, the code makes use of the `memmove` function to re-order the glyph information after merging the clusters. This ensures that the glyphs are shifted correctly after the merge operation.

Overall, the fix corrects the function call to use the existing `merge_clusters` function and ensures the proper re-ordering of glyph information. This resolves the vulnerability and allows the code to compile and run correctly.
