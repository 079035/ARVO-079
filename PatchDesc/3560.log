Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is that the code catches and ignores IOException when calling the `NikonDecompressor::decompress` function.

Summary of the fix:
The vulnerability is fixed by removing the try-catch block that catches and ignores the IOException.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the original code, the `NikonDecompressor::decompress` function is called inside a try block, and if an IOException is caught, the error message is set on `mRaw` and the exception is ignored. This means that any IOException that occurs during the decompression process is silently ignored, and the program continues to execute.

The fix in the diff file removes the try-catch block completely. This means that if an IOException occurs during the decompression process, it will not be caught and ignored. Instead, it will propagate up the call stack, allowing it to be handled appropriately at a higher level or terminating the program if it is not handled.

By removing the try-catch block, the fix ensures that any potential issues during decompression are not silently ignored, but instead brought to the attention of the higher-level code or the user. This increases the overall robustness and reliability of the code.
