Vulnerability: The vulnerability in the code is that it is trying to add the python six dependency using `py-pip` instead of `python-six`. 

Summary of the fix: The fix is to replace `py-pip` with `python-six` in the Dockerfile for adding the python six dependency.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The original code uses `py-pip` to add the python six dependency:
```
RUN apk add --no-cache cmake gcc g++ musl-dev python py-pip python-six make && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*
```
2. The fix replaces `py-pip` with `python-six` in the Dockerfile:
```
RUN apk add --no-cache cmake gcc g++ musl-dev python py-pip py-six make && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*
```
3. This fix ensures that the correct package (`python-six`) is installed for the python six dependency in the Dockerfile.
