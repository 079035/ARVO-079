Vulnerability:
The vulnerability being patched in this diff file is the incorrect handling of IOExceptions during the decoding process in the ArwDecoder.cpp file. The code currently catches IOExceptions and ignores them, potentially leading to the loss of useful data.

Fix Summary:
The fix removes the try-catch blocks that catch IOExceptions from the decoding process. Instead of catching and ignoring the exceptions, the code allows them to propagate, potentially aborting the decoding process.

Detailed Fix:
1. Remove the try-catch block around the DecodeARW function call in the decodeSRF function.
2. Remove the try-catch block around the DecodeUncompressed function call in the decodeRawInternal function.
3. Remove the try-catch block around the DecodeARW and DecodeARW2 function calls in the decodeRawInternal function.
4. Instead of catching and ignoring IOExceptions, allow them to propagate and potentially abort the decoding process.
