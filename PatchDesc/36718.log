Vulnerability:
- The code in the diff file contains a memory leak vulnerability. The function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` allocates memory for the `null_terminated` string using `malloc`, but it does not free it before returning.

Fix - Summary:
- The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a `free(null_terminated)` statement before the function returns.

Fix - Detailed:
1. Locate the line `flb_free(null_terminated);` at the end of the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.
2. Add a new line just before the `flb_free(null_terminated);` line.
3. On the new line, add the code `free(null_terminated);`.
4. Save the changes.

After applying this fix, the `null_terminated` string will be freed before the function returns, resolving the memory leak vulnerability.
