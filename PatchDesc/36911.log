Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in this code is a potential memory leak. If the allocation for table sorting fails, the code does not properly free the previously allocated memory before returning, leading to a memory leak.

Summary of the fix:
The fix addresses the issue by adding a check for an error in the sorting of table entries. If an error is detected, the previously allocated memory is freed, and the function returns early.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. In the "hb-face.cc" file, the function `_hb_face_builder_data_reference_blob` is modified.
2. The code now checks if an error occurred during the sorting of table entries by using the `in_error()` function on the `sorted_entries` vector.
3. If an error is detected, the previously allocated memory `buf` is freed using `hb_free` and the function returns `nullptr`.
4. The fix ensures that the memory allocated for `buf` is properly freed in case of an error, preventing a potential memory leak.
