Vulnerability: Buffer read overflow

Summary of the fix: The fix addresses a buffer read overflow vulnerability in the `exif_mnote_data_apple_load` function of the `exif-mnote-data-apple.c` file. 

Detailed description of the fix: 

1. The function `exif_mnote_data_apple_load` is called to load data from a buffer into the `ExifMnoteDataApple` structure. 
2. The function performs several checks to ensure that the necessary input parameters (`md`, `buf`, `buf_size`) are valid and that the buffer has enough data to process.
3. The vulnerability occurs in the loop that reads and allocates memory for the MakerNote tags. 
4. In the loop, the function checks if the size of the data (`dsize`) is greater than 65536 bytes. If it is, the function continues to the next iteration without processing the current tag. This step is performed to handle corrupt data where the size exceeds the maximum size of a JPEG segment.
5. After this check, the function determines the offset (`dofs`) to read the tag data from the buffer. If the calculated offset plus the data size is greater than the buffer size (`buf_size`), a log message is generated indicating a tag size overflow and the function continues to the next iteration without processing the current tag.
6. Finally, if the previous checks pass, the function allocates memory for the tag data and copies the data from the buffer into the allocated memory.

The fix addresses the vulnerability by adding a check for tag size overflow before allocating memory and copying data from the buffer. If the calculated offset plus the data size is greater than the buffer size, a log message is generated, indicating a tag size overflow, and the function continues to the next iteration without processing the current tag. This prevents the buffer read overflow vulnerability by ensuring that the read operation does not exceed the bounds of the buffer.
