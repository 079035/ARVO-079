1. Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code before the patch was that it did not properly handle invalid encodings during the decoding process. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior or crashes if the program encountered an invalid encoding.

2. Short Summary of the Fix:
The fix added return statements after setting the block type to `SYM_BTYPE_ERROR` in several places. This ensures that the function exits immediately after encountering an invalid encoding, preventing any further processing of the invalid data.

3. Detailed Description of the Fix:
The fix was applied in several places in the `physical_to_symbolic` function. Whenever the function encounters an invalid encoding, it sets the `block_type` of the `symbolic_compressed_block` to `SYM_BTYPE_ERROR`. After this, the function now immediately returns, preventing any further processing of the invalid data. This change was applied in several places, including when handling 2D and 3D void-extents, when the block mode is invalid, when there are too many color endpoint integers, and when the color quantization level is less than `QUANT_6`. Additionally, the assignment of `scb.quant_mode` was moved to after the check for `color_quant_level < QUANT_6`, ensuring that `scb.quant_mode` is only assigned a valid value.
