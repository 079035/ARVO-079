Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that could be patched in the given diff file is the lack of error handling for invalid encodings during the decoding process. Currently, if an invalid encoding is encountered, the `block_type` of the `symbolic_compressed_block` struct is set to `SYM_BTYPE_ERROR`, but the function continues executing without returning. This can lead to invalid or inconsistent data being processed further, potentially causing memory corruption or other runtime errors.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix rejects invalid encodings during the decoding process. If an invalid encoding is detected, the function returns immediately without further processing.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
1. Several sections of code in the `physical_to_symbolic` function have been modified to include an additional `return` statement if an invalid encoding is detected.
2. In the section that handles constant color blocks, if an invalid void-extent condition is found (e.g., when `(vx_low_s >= vx_high_s || vx_low_t >= vx_high_t)` and not `all_ones`), the `block_type` is set to `SYM_BTYPE_ERROR`, and the function returns immediately.
3. If an invalid block mode is encountered (indicated by `packed_index == BLOCK_BAD_BLOCK_MODE`), the `block_type` is set to `SYM_BTYPE_ERROR`, and the function returns immediately.
4. If the `is_dual_plane` flag is true, and both `is_dual_plane` and `partition_count` are 4, indicating an unsupported configuration, the `block_type` is set to `SYM_BTYPE_ERROR`, and the function returns immediately.
5. If the `color_integer_count` is greater than 18, indicating an invalid number of color endpoint integers, the `block_type` is set to `SYM_BTYPE_ERROR`, and the function returns immediately.
6. If the `color_quant_level` is less than `QUANT_6`, indicating an invalid color quantization level, the `block_type` is set to `SYM_BTYPE_ERROR`, and the function returns immediately.

By adding these return statements, the function effectively rejects invalid encodings during the decoding process, ensuring that only valid and consistent data is processed further.
