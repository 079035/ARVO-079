Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is a null-dereference write in the function `MqttProps_Free()` in the `mqtt_client.c` file.

Summary of the fix:
The fix in this patch resolves the null-dereference write issue in `MqttProps_Free()`.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The patch initializes the variables `packet_id` and `packet_type` at the beginning of the function.
2. It then checks the value of `*mms_stat` (a pointer passed to the function) and based on its value, performs different actions.
3. In the `MQTT_MSG_BEGIN` state, the packet state is reset.
4. In the `MQTT_MSG_WAIT` state, it checks if the packet type and ID have already completed, and if so, returns the pending response and removes it from the response list.
5. The `*mms_stat` is set to `MQTT_MSG_WAIT`, and then the function waits for a packet by reading from the client's receive buffer using `MqttPacket_Read()`.
6. The received packet is decoded to get the packet type and ID.
7. In the `MQTT_MSG_READ` or `MQTT_MSG_READ_PAYLOAD` states, it determines if the received packet matches the expected type and ID. If it does, the `waitMatchFound` flag is set to 1. Otherwise, it uses a generic packet object.
8. It checks if there is a pending response for the received packet, and if there is, it sets the `packetProcessing` flag and updates the response object.
9. The packet is then handled using `MqttClient_HandlePacket()`.
10. If there is a pending response, it marks the response as done and sets the return code.
11. The function then checks the value of `*mms_stat` and if it's not `MQTT_CODE_CONTINUE`, it resets the state to `MQTT_MSG_BEGIN`.
12. Finally, the function unlocks the receive lock and returns the return code.
