Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code can be described as follows:
- The `skip_name()` function is used to skip the name part of a contact in a Contact HF (Header Field).
- Inside the function, there is a check for special characters ':' and ';'. If either of these characters is found, the function stops and returns prematurely.
- However, there is a bug in the code where the length of the name part is not properly adjusted when ';' is encountered. As a result, the length of the name part may be incorrect.

Fix Summary:
The fix in the code can be summarized as follows:
- Update the code to properly adjust the length of the name part when encountered with both ':' and ';'.
- This ensures that the length of the name part is correctly calculated, avoiding any potential incorrect behavior.

Detailed Fix Description:
1. In the `skip_name()` function, update the following lines:
```c
if (*p == ':' || *p == ';') {
    if (last_wsp) {
        _s->s = last_wsp;
        _s->len -= last_wsp - _s->s + 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
to:
```c
if (*p == ':' || *p == ';') {
    if (last_wsp) {
        _s->s = last_wsp;
        _s->len -= last_wsp - _s->s;
    } else {
        _s->len -= i;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
2. After making the above changes, recompile and test the code to ensure that the length of the name part is correctly adjusted when encountered with ':' or ';'.
3. The fix ensures that the length of the name part is accurately calculated, avoiding any potential incorrect behavior related to the length of the name part.
