Vulnerability:
In the given diff file, the vulnerability that was patched is a null-dereference WRITE in the function `MqttProps_Free` in the file `mqtt_client.c`.

Summary of the fix:
The fix resolves the null-dereference WRITE vulnerability by correcting the conditional statement in the code.

Detailed description of the fix:
The vulnerability occurs in the `MqttClient_WaitType` function. Prior to the fix, there is a conditional statement that checks if the `wait_type` and `packet_type` are equal, and if the `MqttIsPubRespPacket(packet_type)` is equal to `MqttIsPubRespPacket(wait_type)`. However, the condition is poorly formatted and leads to a null-dereference WRITE vulnerability.

The fix corrects the condition by grouping the checks properly. The fixed code now checks if `wait_type` and `packet_type` are equal and if `MqttIsPubRespPacket(packet_type)` and `MqttIsPubRespPacket(wait_type)` are both true. This ensures that the proper checks are made and the vulnerability is fixed.

Overall, the fix resolves the null-dereference WRITE vulnerability by properly structuring the conditional statement in the code.
