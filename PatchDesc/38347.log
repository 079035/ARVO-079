Vulnerability: In the given diff file, there is a vulnerability related to a check for the predictor order in the subframe header. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when reading subframes with fixed or LPC (Linear Predictive Coding) subframe types. The vulnerability allows a predictor order value that is greater than the block size to pass through without proper validation.

Summary of the Fix: The fix in this patch introduces a check to ensure that the predictor order value is not greater than the block size. If the predictor order is found to be greater than the block size, an error is sent to the client, and the state is set to search for frame synchronization.

Detailed Description of the Fix: 

1. The fix introduces a new variable `predictor_order` which is derived from the bits of the subframe header.

2. For subframes with fixed type, following check is added:
   - If the block size is less than or equal to the predictor order, an error is sent to the client, the state is set to search for frame synchronization, and the function returns true.
   - Otherwise, the `read_subframe_fixed_` function is called to read and decode the subframe.

3. For subframes with LPC type, the same check is added:
   - If the block size is less than or equal to the predictor order, an error is sent to the client, the state is set to search for frame synchronization, and the function returns true.
   - Otherwise, the `read_subframe_lpc_` function is called to read and decode the subframe.

4. The checks ensure that the predictor order value is validated against the block size before processing the associated subframe.
