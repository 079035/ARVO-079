1. Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code lies in the `sanitize` function. The function does not check if there are any subtables before trying to access them. This could lead to a situation where the function tries to access a non-existent subtable, which could potentially lead to undefined behavior or a crash.

2. Short Summary of the Fix:
The fix adds a check to ensure that there are subtables before trying to access them. This is done by adding a condition `subtables` in the `if` statement in the `sanitize` function.

3. Detailed Description of the Fix:
In the `sanitize` function, the code checks if the type of the subtable is `Extension` and if there are no edits. If these conditions are met, the code then checks all subtables of an Extension lookup to ensure they have the same type. However, the original code did not check if there are any subtables before trying to access them. The fix adds this check by including `subtables` in the `if` statement. This ensures that the code only tries to access the subtables if they exist, preventing potential undefined behavior or crashes. The modified line of code is:
```cpp
if (unlikely (get_type () == TSubTable::Extension && subtables && !c->get_edit_count ()))
```
This line checks if the type is `Extension`, if there are subtables, and if there are no edits. If all these conditions are met, the code then proceeds to check the types of the subtables.
