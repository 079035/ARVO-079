Vulnerability:
The vulnerability patched in this diff file is related to an incorrect iteration in the `destroy_all()` function of the `UniformBumpAllocator` class. There are two bugs present:

1. The variable `end_offset` was not considering the alignment that might have been introduced while computing `base_ptr`.
2. The `end_offset` was computing the offset of the first byte that is outside the current chunk. However, this might be in the middle of a hypothetical object. As a result, the loop in `destroy_all()` iterates once too often if the last few bytes of the chunk are unused.

Fix Summary:
The fix ensures that the `end_offset` takes into account the alignment of `base_ptr` and computes the offset of the first byte after the last valid object in case the end of the chunk does not align with the end of an object.

Detailed Fix Description:
The fix involves modifying the calculation of the `end_offset` variable in the `destroy_all()` function of the `UniformBumpAllocator` class.

Before the fix, the `end_offset` was computed as the offset of the first byte after the chunk, without considering alignment:

```cpp
FlatPtr end_offset = this->m_chunk_size - sizeof(typename Allocator::ChunkHeader);
```

After the fix, two changes are made:

1. Compute the offset of the first byte after the chunk by adding the size of the chunk to the base pointer:

```cpp
FlatPtr end_offset = base_ptr + this->m_chunk_size - chunk;
```

2. Compute the offset of the first byte after the last valid object by dividing `end_offset` by the size of `T` (the type being allocated) and then multiplying it by the size of `T` to get the final offset:

```cpp
end_offset = (end_offset / sizeof(T)) * sizeof(T);
```

By making these changes, the `end_offset` now correctly represents the offset of the first byte after the last valid object, considering alignment. This ensures that the loop in the `destroy_all()` function iterates over only the valid objects and avoids iterating once too often.
