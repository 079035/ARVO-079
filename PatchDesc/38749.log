1. Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the original code was that it did not properly validate the URL passed to the `demux_NewAdvanced` function. Specifically, it did not check if the URL contained the "://" pattern, which is a standard part of any URL. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if an invalid URL was passed to the function.

2. Short Summary of the Fix:
The fix adds a check at the beginning of the `demux_NewAdvanced` function to ensure that the URL contains the "://" pattern. If this pattern is not found in the URL, the function sets the error number to `EINVAL` (which stands for "Invalid argument") and returns `NULL`.

3. Detailed Description of the Fix:
The fix involves adding a few lines of code at the beginning of the `demux_NewAdvanced` function. First, it uses the `strstr` function to search for the "://" pattern in the URL. If `strstr` returns `NULL`, this means that the pattern was not found in the URL. In this case, the function sets `errno` to `EINVAL` and returns `NULL`, indicating that an invalid argument was passed to the function.

If the "://" pattern is found in the URL, the function continues as before. However, the fix also modifies the line of code that sets `p_demux->psz_location`. In the original code, this was set to the part of the URL after the "://" pattern, or to an empty string if the pattern was not found. In the fixed code, it is always set to the part of the URL after the "://" pattern, since the function now returns `NULL` if the pattern is not found. This ensures that `p_demux->psz_location` is always set to a valid value.
