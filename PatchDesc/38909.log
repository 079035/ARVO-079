Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is a potential buffer overflow in the `parse_content_length` function. 

Summary of Fix:
The fix adds an additional check for the `content length` to ensure that it does not span across multiple lines. This prevents a potential buffer overflow and ensures the correct parsing of the `content length` value.

Detailed Description of Fix:
In the original code, the parsing of the `content length` value was prone to buffer overflow if the length value spanned across multiple lines. The fix addresses this vulnerability by adding an additional check for the `content length` value to ensure that it is not followed by a newline character (`\n`) and space or tab characters (` ' ` or `\t`) on the next line. This check is performed within the while loop on line 35.

If a newline character is encountered after a number is parsed, the code continues to check for additional lines in the header body. If the subsequent line starts with a space or tab character, it is considered a continuation of the header body and the parsing continues. However, if the subsequent line starts with any other character, it is considered the end of the header body and the parsing stops. This prevents the buffer overflow by ensuring that the `content length` value is not mistakenly interpreted as a continuation of the header body.

This additional check ensures that the parsing of the `content length` value is correct and prevents potential buffer overflow issues in the `parse_content_length` function.
