Vulnerability:
Null-dereference WRITE in MqttProps_Free

Summary of the Fix:
The fix resolves a null-dereference issue in the MqttProps_Free function.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
In the provided diff, the vulnerable code is found in the `MqttClient_WaitType` function. The vulnerability occurs in a specific block of code where the program waits for a packet. The vulnerable code can be summarized as follows:

```c
if ((wait_type == MQTT_PACKET_TYPE_ANY ||
    wait_type == packet_type ||
    MqttIsPubRespPacket(packet_type) == MqttIsPubRespPacket(wait_type)) &&
    (wait_packet_id == 0 || wait_packet_id == packet_id))
{
    use_packet_obj = packet_obj;
    waitMatchFound = 1;
}
```

In this code, there is a null-dereference issue because the `packet_obj` variable is used without checking if it is NULL or not. This can lead to a crash when accessing the `packet_obj` if it is NULL.

The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a null check for the `packet_obj` variable before using it. Here is the fixed code:

```c
if ((wait_type == MQTT_PACKET_TYPE_ANY ||
    wait_type == packet_type ||
    MqttIsPubRespPacket(packet_type) == MqttIsPubRespPacket(wait_type)) &&
    (wait_packet_id == 0 || wait_packet_id == packet_id))
{
    if (packet_obj != NULL) {
        use_packet_obj = packet_obj;
    }
    waitMatchFound = 1;
}
```

With this fix, the `packet_obj` variable is only used if it is not NULL, avoiding the null-dereference issue.
