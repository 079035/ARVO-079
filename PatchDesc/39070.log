Vulnerability Description:
In the given diff file, the vulnerability is a null-dereference write in the function `MqttProps_Free`. 

Summary of the Fix:
The fix addresses the null-dereference write vulnerability in the `MqttProps_Free` function.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
The fix includes the following changes:

1. Previously, in the function `MqttProps_Free`, there was no null check before accessing the `properties` pointer. This could lead to a null-dereference write error if the `properties` pointer was null.
   - Before the fix:
     ```c
     MqttProp_Free(properties);
     ```

2. The fix adds a null check before accessing the `properties` pointer. If the `properties` pointer is null, it will skip the `MqttProp_Free` operation to avoid the null-dereference write error.
   - After the fix:
     ```c
     if (properties != NULL) {
         MqttProp_Free(properties);
     }
     ```

The fix ensures that the `MqttProps_Free` function does not cause a null-dereference write error.
