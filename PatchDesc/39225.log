Vulnerability:
The vulnerability patched in this diff file is a potential out-of-bounds read in the `collect_coverage_and_indices` function.

Summary of the fix:
The fix in this patch is to add boundary checks before accessing the `vertGlyphCoverage` and `horizGlyphCoverage` arrays in the `collect_coverage_and_indices` function.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. In the `collect_coverage_and_indices` function, a check is added to return early if the `coverage` parameter is null. This prevents accessing the coverage data when it is not available.
2. The `i` variable is checked against the `end_index` parameter to ensure that it is within a valid range before accessing the glyphset.
3. If the index `i` is greater than or equal to `end_index`, the function returns early to prevent accessing the glyphset and adding indices beyond the valid range.
4. These boundary checks ensure that the function operates within the bounds of the available coverage data, preventing potential out-of-bounds reads.
