Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the provided diff file is related to inconsistent indentation of code in the `PSDSkipImage` function.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix in the diff file addresses the inconsistent indentation issue by aligning the return statement to match the indentation level of the if statement.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
In the original code, the `return` statement in the `PSDSkipImage` function is not properly indented. It is indented with four spaces instead of the expected two spaces, which violates the coding style of the project.

The fix in the diff file corrects the indentation by aligning the `return` statement with the opening curly brace of the `if` statement. This ensures consistent indentation and improves code readability.

Before the fix:
```c
if (psd_info->has_merged_image == MagickFalse)
    return(MagickFalse);
```

After the fix:
```c
if (psd_info->has_merged_image == MagickFalse)
  return(MagickFalse);
```

By aligning the `return` statement, the code follows the coding style convention of the project and enhances code clarity and maintainability.
