Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is a code formatting issue where the indentation of the return statement in the `PSDSkipImage` function is incorrect.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix corrects the indentation of the return statement in the `PSDSkipImage` function.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
The fix in the code is a simple correction of indentation. In the original code, the return statement inside the `PSDSkipImage` function is not indented properly. It should have been aligned with the if statement above it. The fixed code properly aligns the return statement with the if statement by adding spaces before `return`.

Before fix:
```
if (psd_info->has_merged_image == MagickFalse)
    return(MagickFalse);
```

After fix:
```
if (psd_info->has_merged_image == MagickFalse)
  return(MagickFalse);
```

This fix ensures that the code is properly formatted and follows a consistent indentation style, improving code readability and maintainability.
