Vulnerability:
There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the code. The variable "tocopy" is declared as an int, but when the size to be copied is larger than the maximum value of an int (MAXINT), it could result in "tocopy" becoming negative. When a negative value is converted to bfd_size_type, it becomes extremely large.

Summary of the fix:
The fix corrects the calculation of "tocopy" by changing the variable types. The variable "tocopy" is changed from int to bfd_size_type to avoid overflow issues.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The variable declaration of "tocopy" is changed from `int tocopy;` to `bfd_size_type tocopy;`. This ensures that "tocopy" can handle larger sizes without becoming negative.
2. The variable "size" is changed from `long size;` to `off_t size;`. This change aligns the variable type with the return type of `bfd_stat_arch_elt` function, which is `off_t`. It ensures consistency and avoids any potential type conversion issues.
3. In the while loop condition, the check `while (ncopied < size)` is changed to `while (size != 0)`. This change ensures that the loop continues until the entire size is copied, rather than relying on the `ncopied` variable. 
4. The calculation of "tocopy" is simplified. Instead of using `tocopy = size - ncopied;`, it is updated to `tocopy = (size > BUFSIZE) ? BUFSIZE : size;`. This change sets "tocopy" as BUFSIZE when `size` is larger than BUFSIZE, otherwise it sets "tocopy" as "size". This ensures that "tocopy" is always within the valid range and avoids buffer overflow.
5. The type of arguments passed to `bfd_bread` and `bfd_bwrite` functions is updated to `tocopy` instead of casting to `bfd_size_type`. This change aligns the argument types with the updated declaration of "tocopy".

After applying the fix, the code now correctly handles copying objects and avoids buffer overflow vulnerabilities that could be caused by negative "tocopy" values.
