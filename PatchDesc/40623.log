Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in this code can be described as a potential negative length in the `exif_data_load_data()` function. The code checks for the length of the data, but it does not handle the case where the length is less than 2. This can lead to a negative value for the `len` variable, which could cause undefined behavior or other issues later in the function.

Fix Summary:
The fix adds a check for the length being less than 2 and returns early from the function if this condition is met. It also logs an error message indicating that the APP Tag (part of the EXIF data) is too short.

Detailed Fix:
The fix consists of the following changes:

1. After calculating the `len` variable from the data, a new check is added to verify if `len` is less than 2. This check ensures that the length is valid and prevents it from becoming a negative value.

```c
if (len < 2) {
    exif_log(data->priv->log, EXIF_LOG_CODE_CORRUPT_DATA, "ExifData", _("APP Tag too short."));
    return;
}
```

2. If the length is less than 2, the function returns early, indicating a corrupt APP Tag. This prevents the function from continuing with potentially invalid data.

```c
exif_log(data->priv->log, EXIF_LOG_CODE_CORRUPT_DATA, "ExifData", _("APP Tag too short."));
return;
```

The added check ensures that the length of the APP Tag is valid and prevents any negative values from causing issues further in the function.
