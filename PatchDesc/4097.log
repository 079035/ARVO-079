Vulnerability:
Heap use after free.

Summary of the fix:
The fix ensures that any remaining publish responses are sent if the last subscription is removed.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the original code, if the last subscription was removed and the condition `if(LIST_FIRST(&session->serverSubscriptions))` returned false, the code would call `UA_Server_delayedCallback` to send any remaining publish responses in a delayed callback. However, this introduces a potential vulnerability of heap use after free, where memory that has been freed is still being accessed.

The fix modifies the code to call `UA_Subscription_answerPublishRequestsNoSubscription` directly, instead of using the delayed callback. This ensures that any remaining publish responses are sent before the session is deleted, without the risk of heap use after free.

The fix makes the code safer and eliminates the possibility of heap use after free vulnerability.
