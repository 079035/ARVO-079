Vulnerability:

The vulnerability in the given diff file is an unsafe indexing issue in the function `apply_stch()`. Specifically, the issue occurs in the line:

```
buffer->unsafe_to_break (context, end + 1);
```

Summary of the fix:

The fix addresses the unsafe indexing issue by changing the second argument of the `unsafe_to_break()` function call to `end` instead of `end + 1`.

Detailed description of the fix:

The `apply_stch()` function is used in shaping complex Arabic text. In the code, there is a loop that iterates through the glyph information in the buffer to determine the number of repeating tiles needed for stretching Arabic text. At the end of this loop, there is a block of code that modifies the buffer to apply the stretching and copies the glyphs accordingly.

In the original code, there is an unsafe indexing issue. The `buffer->unsafe_to_break()` function call is used to mark a range of glyphs as unsafe to break between when shaping the text. However, the second argument of this function call is incorrect. It should be `end` rather than `end + 1`. This means that the range being marked as unsafe to break includes one extra glyph that should not be included.

The fix corrects this issue by changing the second argument of the `unsafe_to_break()` function call to `end`. This ensures that the range of glyphs being marked as unsafe to break is correct and does not include any extra glyphs.

Overall, the fix addresses the unsafe indexing issue in the code by correcting the argument of the `unsafe_to_break()` function call in the `apply_stch()` function.
