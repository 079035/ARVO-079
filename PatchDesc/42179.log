Vulnerability:
Heap-buffer-overflow in bpf_elf_generic_reloc

Summary of the fix:
The fix handles bitpos offset relocation range checking in the "bpf_elf_generic_reloc" function.

Detailed description of the fix:
The code fix introduces a check to ensure that the address of the relocation entry is within the range of the input section. It calculates the end address of the input section using "bfd_get_section_limit_octets" and compares it against the relocation entry address plus the size of the relocation. If the address is out of range, the function returns "bfd_reloc_outofrange". This prevents a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability.

The fix also adjusts the calculation of the relocation size based on the type of relocation. For the R_BPF_INSN_64 type, the relocation size is set to 16. Otherwise, it is calculated based on the bitsize and bitpos specified in the relocation entry.

After the range checking and size calculation, the fix proceeds to install the relocation by updating the appropriate memory locations with the relocated value.

Overall, the fix ensures that the relocation process in the "bpf_elf_generic_reloc" function is handled correctly, addressing the heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability and preventing potential out-of-bounds memory access.
