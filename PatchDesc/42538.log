Vulnerability:
The vulnerability patched in this diff file is the possibility to read off the end of an invalid DNS response. This vulnerability can occur when parsing a DNS response in the `g_resolver_records_from_res_query` function of the `gthreadedresolver.c` file.

Summary of the fix:
The fix checks the length of the DNS response before parsing it. If the length is less than the size of the `HEADER` struct, indicating a malformed DNS packet, an appropriate error message is set and the function returns NULL.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. A variable `len_unsigned` of type `gsize` is introduced to hold the unsigned length of the DNS response.
2. The value of `len_unsigned` is assigned the value of `len`, casted to `gsize`.
3. An if statement is added to check if `len_unsigned` is less than the size of the `HEADER` struct. If it is, meaning the DNS packet is malformed, an error message is set using `g_set_error` and the function returns NULL.
4. The parsing of the DNS response continues only if the DNS packet is valid, i.e., its length is greater than or equal to the size of the `HEADER` struct.
5. Other parts of the code that rely on the assumption that `len` is non-negative are updated to use `len_unsigned` instead.
6. The fix ensures that if the DNS response is empty or the requested DNS record type is not found, the appropriate error message is set and NULL is returned.
