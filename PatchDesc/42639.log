Vulnerability:
Heap buffer overflow in `_bfd_mips_elf_section_from_shdr` function in `elfxx-mips.c` file.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix addressed a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the `_bfd_mips_elf_section_from_shdr` function by adding checks for the size of `intopt` and the remaining bytes in the section. If the size or the remaining bytes is smaller than expected, the function will handle it as a truncated option and emit a warning message.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
In the `elfxx-mips.c` file, the `_bfd_mips_elf_section_from_shdr` function is responsible for setting the correct type for a MIPS ELF section based on its name. However, the function had a vulnerability that allowed a heap buffer overflow.

The fix added additional checks to ensure that the `intopt` size is not smaller than the size of `Elf_External_Options`. If the size is smaller, the function handles it as a truncated option and emits a warning message using the `_bfd_error_handler` function.

The fix also checks if the remaining bytes in the section are enough to contain the expected data for `Elf64_External_RegInfo` or `Elf32_External_RegInfo`, depending on the ABI. If the remaining bytes are not enough, the function also handles it as a truncated option and emits a warning message.

These checks prevent the heap buffer overflow from occurring and ensure that the function handles truncated options gracefully.
