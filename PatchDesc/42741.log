Vulnerability:
The vulnerability patched in the given diff file is a potential out-of-bounds read in libsepol's `mls_semantic_level_expand` function. The code fails to check if the sensitivity value `sl->sens` is valid before performing a lookup in the `p_sens_val_to_name` array. This can lead to reading beyond the bounds of the array and can cause a crash or other undefined behavior.

Fix Summary:
In the fix, a check is added to ensure the sensitivity value is within the valid range `1` to `p->p_levels.nprim` and that the corresponding `p_sens_val_to_name` array element is not NULL. If the sensitivity value is invalid, the function returns an error code (-1) indicating the failure.

Detailed Fix Description:
Before assigning the sensitivity value `sl->sens` to the `l->sens` field, the code performs the following check:

```
if (sl->sens > p->p_levels.nprim || !p->p_sens_val_to_name[sl->sens - 1])
    return -1;
```

The check condition consists of two parts:

1. `sl->sens > p->p_levels.nprim`: This checks if the sensitivity value is greater than the number of primary levels (`p->p_levels.nprim`). If it is, it means the sensitivity value is invalid, and the function returns -1.

2. `!p->p_sens_val_to_name[sl->sens - 1]`: This checks if the element at index `sl->sens - 1` in the `p_sens_val_to_name` array is NULL. If it is NULL, it means the sensitivity value is invalid, and the function returns -1.

If either of the conditions is true, indicating an invalid sensitivity value, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the valid sensitivity value is assigned to `l->sens` and further processing continues.

This fix ensures that the code performs the necessary checks before accessing the `p_sens_val_to_name` array, preventing a potential out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
