1. Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code is related to a lack of validation for the sensitivity level before lookup. This could potentially lead to a memory access violation, as indicated by the oss-fuzz report. The code was reading memory that it wasn't supposed to, which could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.

2. Short Summary of the Fix:
The fix involves adding a check for the validity of the sensitivity level before performing the lookup operation. This ensures that the lookup in the name array `p_sens_val_to_name` is valid and prevents invalid memory access.

3. Detailed Description of the Fix:
The fix is implemented in the `mls_semantic_level_expand` function. Before the fix, the function would directly use the sensitivity level `sl->sens` for lookup without any validation. The patch adds a check to ensure that `sl->sens` is within the valid range and that the corresponding entry in the `p_sens_val_to_name` array is not null. If either of these conditions is not met, the function returns -1 to indicate an error. This prevents the function from proceeding with an invalid sensitivity level, which could lead to invalid memory access.
