Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that could be patched in the given diff file is a build issue in the `build_google_oss_fuzzers.sh` script. 

Summary of the Fix:
The fix in the patch involves correcting the build command by rearranging the order of the linker flags.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
In the original code, the build command includes the `-lpthread` flag before the `-lm` flag, which causes a build error. To fix this issue, the order of the linker flags is changed in the patch. The updated build command now includes the `-lm` flag before the `-lpthread` flag, ensuring the correct order of the linker flags. This fix resolves the build issue and allows the script to compile successfully.
