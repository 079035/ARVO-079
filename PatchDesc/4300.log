1. Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code was a double free vulnerability. This occurs when the program tries to free a memory location that has already been freed. This can lead to program crash or, in some cases, execution of arbitrary code.

2. Short Summary of the Fix:
The fix was to replace a direct assignment of a NodeId with a call to the UA_NodeId_copy function. This ensures that a new copy of the NodeId is created and used, preventing the double free issue.

3. Detailed Description of the Fix:
In the original code, the NodeId was directly assigned to `dst->content.encoded.typeId` from `*typeId`. This means that when `*typeId` was freed, `dst->content.encoded.typeId` would also be freed, leading to a double free when `dst->content.encoded.typeId` was later freed.

The fix replaces this direct assignment with a call to `UA_NodeId_copy(typeId, &dst->content.encoded.typeId)`. This function creates a new copy of `typeId` and assigns it to `dst->content.encoded.typeId`. This way, when `*typeId` is freed, `dst->content.encoded.typeId` is still valid and can be safely freed later, preventing the double free.
