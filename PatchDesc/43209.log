Vulnerability:
The vulnerability patched in this diff file is an issue where the code does not properly check if a class is a kernel class before associating it with a common class.

Summary of Fix:
The fix ensures that the class in a classcommon is a kernel class before associating it with a common class. If the class is not a kernel class, an error is returned.

Detailed Description of Fix:
The fix involves adding an additional check before associating a class with a common class. It checks the flavor of the class datum to ensure that it is a kernel class. If the class is not a kernel class, an error message is logged and the function returns an error. This ensures that only kernel classes can be associated with commons.

Here is the modified code:
```c
rc = cil_resolve_name(current, clscom->class_str, CIL_SYM_CLASSES, extra_args, &class_datum);
if (rc != SEPOL_OK) {
    goto exit;
}
if (NODE(class_datum)->flavor != CIL_CLASS) {
    cil_log(CIL_ERR, "Class %s is not a kernel class and cannot be associated with common %s\n", clscom->class_str, clscom->common_str);
    rc = SEPOL_ERR;
    goto exit;
}

// Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

This fix ensures that classes other than kernel classes cannot be associated with a common class, preventing potential issues and maintaining the integrity of the code.
