1. Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the original code was that it could lead to uninitialized pixels when the image data was truncated. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior or incorrect image rendering.

2. Short Summary of the Fix:
The fix involves ensuring that the composite data is zeroed out during allocation to avoid uninitialized pixels in the case of truncated image data.

3. Detailed Description of the Fix:
In the original code, the `GrkImage::allocData(destComp)` function was called without any arguments. This function is responsible for allocating memory for the image data. However, in the updated code, `GrkImage::allocData(destComp, true)` is called instead. The second argument, `true`, indicates that the allocated memory should be zero-initialized. This ensures that even if the image data is truncated, all pixels will at least be initialized to zero, preventing any undefined behavior or incorrect image rendering that could occur from uninitialized pixels.
