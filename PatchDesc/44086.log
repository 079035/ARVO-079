Vulnerability Description:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is an invalid use of material reference. It occurs in the `ParseLV2MaterialBlock` function.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix for this vulnerability is to correctly parse the material block by including a check for the validity of the submaterial index.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
1. The fix involves adding a check for the validity of the submaterial index before parsing the material block.
2. Firstly, the variable `iNumSubMaterials` is used to store the number of submaterials. It is initialized to 0.
3. Inside the while loop, when encountering the token "NUMSUBMTLS", the function `ParseLV4MeshLong` is used to parse the number of submaterials and store it in `iNumSubMaterials`.
4. After parsing the number of submaterials, the code checks if the submaterial index `iIndex` is valid. If it is larger than or equal to the number of submaterials (`iNumSubMaterials`), a warning message is logged and `iIndex` is set to the maximum valid index (`iNumSubMaterials - 1`).
5. Then, the code retrieves a reference to the submaterial at the given index (`iIndex`) in `mat.avSubMaterials`.
6. After getting a reference to the submaterial, the fix includes parsing the material block by invoking the `ParseLV2MaterialBlock` function with the extracted submaterial reference (`sMat`) as the argument.
7. The fix ensures that the material block is correctly parsed for each valid submaterial.

By making these changes, the fix ensures the correct use of material references and prevents any invalid access or undefined behavior.
