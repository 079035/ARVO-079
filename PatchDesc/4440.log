Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is that the dimensions of the image are being compared with signed integers instead of unsigned integers in the functions `getData` and `getDataUncropped`. This can lead to undefined behavior and potential incorrect memory access if the dimensions of the image are larger than the maximum value that can be represented by a signed integer.

Fix Summary:
The fix involves changing the comparison from signed integers to unsigned integers in the conditions where the dimensions are checked.

Fix Description:
1. In the `getData` function:
   - Replace the condition `if (static_cast<int>(x) >= dim.x)` with `if (x >= static_cast<unsigned>(uncropped_dim.x))`.
   - Replace the condition `if (y >= static_cast<unsigned>(uncropped_dim.y))` with `if (y >= static_cast<unsigned>(uncropped_dim.y))`.

2. In the `getDataUncropped` function:
   - Replace the condition `if (static_cast<int>(x) >= uncropped_dim.x)` with `if (x >= static_cast<unsigned>(uncropped_dim.x))`.
   - Replace the condition `if (y >= static_cast<unsigned>(uncropped_dim.y))` with `if (y >= static_cast<unsigned>(uncropped_dim.y))`.
