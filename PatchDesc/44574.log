Vulnerability: Out-of-bounds (OOB) read

Summary of the Fix: The fix corrects the bounds check for the OOB read vulnerability.

Detailed Description of the Fix: 
In the original code, there is a logical error related to bounds checking when parsing a numerical value. In the line `(str_val[0] == '-' && str_end > str_val && isdigit(str_val[1]))`, the condition `str_end > str_val` is incorrect as it should be `str_val + 1 < str_end`. This error leads to an out-of-bounds read when checking if the second character is a digit.

The fix modifies the condition to `str_val + 1 < str_end`, which correctly checks if there is at least one more character (str_val[1]) after the '-' character to avoid accessing memory outside the bounds of the string. This fixes the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.

Note: The diff file does not show the complete context of the code, so the vulnerability might depend on other parts of the code not visible in the diff. The fix described above is based on the information provided in the diff.
