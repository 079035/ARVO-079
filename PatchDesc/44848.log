Vulnerability:
Index-out-of-bounds in WelsDec::WelsInitRefList

Summary of the fix:
The fix ensures that the index to access the array `pRefPic->pLongRefList[LIST_0]` is within bounds by checking if `pRefPic->uiLongRefCount[LIST_0]` is less than `MAX_REF_PIC_COUNT` before incrementing it.

Description of the fix:
In the original code, the variable `pRefPic->uiLongRefCount[LIST_0]` was incremented without checking if it exceeded the bounds of the array `pRefPic->pLongRefList[LIST_0]`. This could lead to an index-out-of-bounds issue when accessing the array. 

The fix adds a check before incrementing `pRefPic->uiLongRefCount[LIST_0]` to ensure that it is less than `MAX_REF_PIC_COUNT`, the maximum number of elements in the array. If the check is true, the variable is incremented. This prevents the index-out-of-bounds vulnerability by ensuring that the array is not accessed beyond its bounds.

By performing the check, the fix ensures that the array index is always within the valid range, preventing any potential index-out-of-bounds issues.
