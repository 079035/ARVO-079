Vulnerability:
Heap-buffer-overflow WRITE 2 in function `do_fileid()`

Summary of the fix:
The fix addresses an issue where an input checking was not properly done, leading to a heap-buffer-overflow WRITE of 2 bytes in the `do_fileid()` function.

Detailed description of the fix:
1.	In the original code, the function `do_fileid()` reads a file ID from the command line argument and performs some checks.
2.	The fix adds an additional input check to ensure that the length of the file path does not exceed the size of the buffer.
3.	A condition is added to check if the length of the file path, along with the additional 2 bytes for the new file ID, exceeds the size of the buffer.
4.	If the condition is true, a parse_error is called with an error message and returns an error code.
5.	This prevents a heap-buffer-overflow WRITE of 2 bytes, as the length of the file path is checked before copying the new file ID.
6.	The fix ensures that the file path is properly updated with the new file ID and the function returns without any further issues.

Note: The fix does not provide information about the specific input conditions that trigger the vulnerability, or any potential impacts of the vulnerability.
