Vulnerability Description:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is that the `mallocarray` function is used to allocate memory for the `bool_val_to_struct` array in the `cond_init_bool_indexes` function of the `conditional.c` file. The code is modified to use the `calloc` function instead in order to initialize the allocated memory to zero.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix in the provided diff file is to replace the usage of `mallocarray` with `calloc` when allocating memory for the `bool_val_to_struct` array. This ensures that all elements of the array are initialized to zero, preventing the usage of uninitialized memory.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
In the vulnerable code, `mallocarray` is used to allocate memory for the `bool_val_to_struct` array. However, `mallocarray` only allocates memory without initializing it. This means that the elements of the array will contain unpredictable values, which can lead to undefined behavior when accessing or using the array.

To fix this vulnerability, the code is modified to use the `calloc` function instead. `calloc` not only allocates memory but also initializes it by setting all the bytes to zero. By using `calloc`, the `bool_val_to_struct` array is properly initialized with zero values for all elements.

This fix ensures that when validating malformed binary policies, the `bool_val_to_struct` array will not contain any unpredictable or uninitialized values. This prevents potential security vulnerabilities or undefined behavior caused by using uninitialized memory and improves the overall safety and reliability of the code.
