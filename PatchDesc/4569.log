Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that is being patched in this diff file is a potential memory leak. 

Summary of the fix:
The fix involves deleting the old array dimensions before assigning new array dimensions to the `node` variable. 

Detailed description of the fix:
1. In the original code, the `oldArrayDimensions` are assigned the value of `node->arrayDimensions` before assigning new dimensions to `node`. However, there is no deletion or freeing of memory for the old array dimensions.
2. The fix includes adding a new variable `oldArrayDimensionsSize` to store the size of the old array dimensions.
3. The function `UA_Array_delete()` is used to delete the old array dimensions and free the memory.
4. Finally, the `node->arrayDimensions` is assigned the new array dimensions, and the `node->arrayDimensionsSize` is updated to `arrayDimensionsSize`.
5. The fix ensures that the old array dimensions are properly freed, preventing any memory leaks.
