Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is that it includes redundant code that allocates a dummy context for the sws/swr libraries and tries to set options on it to check if they are valid. However, these options will be checked later when they are actually applied on the context used for conversion. This redundant code can be removed to simplify the codebase.

Summary of the fix:
The fix in the given diff file is to drop the redundant code that allocates dummy contexts and sets options on them.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the given diff file, the following changes were made to fix the vulnerability:

1. The code that allocates a dummy `SwsContext` (for sws library) and `SwrContext` (for swr library) contexts and sets options on them was removed. This code was unnecessary since the options will be checked when they are later applied on the actual contexts used for conversion.

2. The function `sws_freeContext()` was removed because the `sws` context is no longer allocated.

3. The function `swr_free()` was removed because the `swr` context is no longer allocated.

The fix eliminates the redundant code and simplifies the codebase by not allocating and setting options on dummy contexts. Now, the options will be checked when they are applied on the actual contexts during conversion.
