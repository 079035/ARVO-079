Vulnerability: Heap-buffer-overflow WRITE 2 in the function `do_fileid` in the file "src/pkcs15init/profile.c" is fixed.

Summary of the Fix: The fix addresses a vulnerability that could cause a heap buffer overflow during the execution of the `do_fileid` function.

Detailed Description of the Fix: The fix involves adding input checking to prevent a heap buffer overflow. Prior to the fix, the code did not check the length of the file path before copying the contents of `temp.value` to `path->value`. This vulnerability could be triggered by providing an excessively long file path as the input.

To mitigate the issue, the fix includes the addition of an input length check before the memcpy operation. Specifically, the code now checks whether the length of `path->len` (representing the current length of the file path) combined with the length of `temp` (2 bytes) exceeds the size of the buffer `path->value`. If the combined length is too long, an error message is displayed, and the function returns with an error code. This prevents the buffer overflow condition from occurring.

Overall, the fix ensures that the file path is properly validated and prevents a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the `do_fileid` function.
