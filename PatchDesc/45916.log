Vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)

Summary of the fix: The fix reduces the rate at which logs are generated in the perf_test example from 2000 logs per second to 20 logs per second.

Detailed description of the fix:
The vulnerability in the code is a potential DoS issue caused by generating logs at a high rate. In the perf_test example, the LOG_RATE parameter was set to 2000, which means 2000 logs per second would be generated. This high rate of log generation could overwhelm the system and lead to resource exhaustion.

The fix in this diff file addresses the vulnerability by reducing the log generation rate. The LOG_RATE parameter is changed from 2000 to 20, significantly reducing the workload on the system. With this fix, only 20 logs per second will be generated, which is a more manageable rate.

By reducing the log generation rate, the fix mitigates the risk of DoS by ensuring that the system is not overwhelmed with an excessive number of logs. This change allows the system to function more effectively and prevents potential resource exhaustion issues.
