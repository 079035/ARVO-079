Vulnerability:
The variables `NeededInt`, `NeededSSE`, and `MaxVectorWidth` are being used uninitialized in the function `X86_64ABIInfo::computeInfo(CGFunctionInfo &FI)`.

Summary of the fix:
The fix initializes the variables `NeededInt`, `NeededSSE`, and `MaxVectorWidth` to zero before using them.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the original code, the variables `NeededInt`, `NeededSSE`, and `MaxVectorWidth` are declared but not initialized. This means that their initial values are unknown and could contain garbage values. 

In the fixed code, the variables `NeededInt`, `NeededSSE`, and `MaxVectorWidth` are initialized to zero (`0`) before they are used. This ensures that they have a known and valid initial value. 

By initializing these variables to zero, the code guarantees that they will have predictable values when used later in the function. This fix resolves the issue of using uninitialized variables, which could lead to undefined behavior and unexpected results in the code execution.
