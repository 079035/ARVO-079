Vulnerability:
The vulnerability patched in this code is a potential overflow in the `CheckFile` core reading function in the OpenEXRUtil library. 

Summary of the Fix:
The fix addresses the potential overflow issue by checking if the offset and size parameters exceed the maximum allowed value of `md->bytes` before performing the read operation.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
1. In the `memstream_read` function, the fix is implemented in the following line:
   ```cpp
   if (offset > md->bytes || sz > md->bytes || offset+sz > md->bytes)
   ```

2. Previously, the condition `(offset + sz) > md->bytes` was used to check if the sum of `offset` and `sz` exceeds the value of `md->bytes`.

3. The fix modifies the condition to `(offset > md->bytes || sz > md->bytes || offset+sz > md->bytes)` which covers all possible scenarios where an overflow can occur.

4. The fixed condition checks whether `offset` is greater than `md->bytes`, whether `sz` is greater than `md->bytes`, or whether the sum of `offset` and `sz` is greater than `md->bytes`.

5. If any of these conditions are true, the value of `left` is set to 0, indicating that the read operation should not be performed.

6. This fix ensures that the function handles potential overflows correctly and avoids reading beyond the allowed memory range.
