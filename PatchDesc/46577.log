Detailed Description of Fix: The fix in the diff file updates the LIBRAW_VERSION_TAIL macro from "Beta1" to "RC1". This macro is used to define the version tail of the LibRaw library. In this case, the version tail was incorrect and needed to be changed to reflect the correct version of the library. By updating the macro, the correct version information is now included in the LIBRAW_VERSION_STR macro, which is used to generate the library version string. This ensures that the library version is accurately represented.
