Vulnerability:
The vulnerability patched in this diff file is an out-of-range access vulnerability.

Summary of the fix:
The fix adds a check to ensure that the index `i` being accessed in the `get_offset` function is within the range of valid indices. If the index `i` is greater than `glyphCount`, the function returns 0 instead of accessing the corresponding array element.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the `get_offset` function of the `gvar` struct, the fix adds the following code snippet before accessing the array elements:

```cpp
if (unlikely (i > glyphCount)) return 0;
```

This check ensures that if the index `i` is greater than `glyphCount`, the function returns 0 and prevents access to out-of-range array elements.

By adding this check, the fix protects against out-of-range access and eliminates the possibility of a crash or undefined behavior due to accessing invalid indices.
