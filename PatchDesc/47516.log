Vulnerability:
The vulnerability fixed in this diff file is a use-after-free bug.

Summary of the fix:
The fix addresses the use-after-free bug in the `TraverseExpressions` function in the file `traverse_expressions.h` of the `tint::ast` namespace.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The fix introduces a new struct called `Pending`, which holds the expression and its depth.
```cpp
struct Pending {
    const ast::Expression* expr;
    size_t depth;
};
```
2. The fix initializes a vector called `to_visit` with a single element, which is the root expression along with a depth of 0.
```cpp
std::vector<Pending> to_visit{{root, 0}};
```
3. The fix modifies the main loop to use the new `Pending` struct and `to_visit` vector.
```cpp
while (!to_visit.empty()) {
    auto p = to_visit.back();
    to_visit.pop_back();
    const ast::Expression* expr = p.expr;
    
    // Rest of the code unchanged...
}
```
4. By using the `auto` keyword and making a copy of the `Pending` struct, the fix ensures that the expression being processed is not accessed after it has been popped from the `to_visit` vector. This avoids the use-after-free vulnerability.
```cpp
auto p = to_visit.back();
to_visit.pop_back();
const ast::Expression* expr = p.expr;
```
5. The fix verifies the type of the expression and calls the callback function accordingly, with the current depth if `kHasDepthArg` is true for the callback signature.
6. The fix handles the different expression types appropriately, pushing them into the `to_visit` vector for further traversal, if necessary.
7. The fix includes additional checks for leaf expressions and unhandled expression types, providing appropriate error handling and returning false in case of an error.
8. The fix returns true at the end of the function to indicate a successful traversal.

Overall, the fix ensures the safe traversal of expressions without encountering a use-after-free vulnerability.
