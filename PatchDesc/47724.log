1. Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code was a heap-buffer-overflow error. This type of error occurs when a program writes more data to a block of allocated memory (heap) than it can hold. In this case, the error was triggered when the program tried to read a string from a memory location that was beyond the allocated memory block. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or even code execution if an attacker can control the overflow.

2. Short Summary of the Fix:
The fix for this vulnerability involved changing the way strings were read from memory in the `ndpi_check_http_header` function. Instead of reading the string directly using the pointer, the code now reads only up to the length of the string, preventing it from reading beyond the allocated memory.

3. Detailed Description of the Fix:
The fix was applied in the `ndpi_check_http_header` function. This function checks HTTP headers for suspicious content. For each header, it was using the `snprintf` function to copy the header content into a buffer. The problem was that it was using the `%s` format specifier, which reads until it encounters a null character. If the header content didn't contain a null character, `snprintf` would read beyond the end of the allocated memory, causing a heap-buffer-overflow.

The fix changes the `%s` format specifier to `%.*s`. The `*` in the format specifier means that the length of the string is passed as an argument to `snprintf`. This way, `snprintf` only reads as many characters as the length of the string, preventing it from reading beyond the allocated memory. The length of the string is stored in `packet->line[i].len`, so this value is passed as the argument for the `*` in the format specifier. This change was made for each case in the switch statement where `snprintf` was used.
