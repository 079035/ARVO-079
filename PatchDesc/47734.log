Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that could be patched in this diff file is a heap buffer overflow error. This vulnerability is identified as an "AddressSanitizer" error, specifically a "heap-buffer-overflow" error. The error occurs at address 0x60b000014739, and it is a READ operation of size 12 at that address. The error is triggered in the `ndpi_check_http_header` function at line 982 of the `http.c` file. The vulnerability was discovered by oss-fuzzer and reported in the bug tracker.

Summary of the fix:
The fix for the vulnerability involves modifying the `ndpi_check_http_header` function to correctly handle the length of the packet line strings when using `snprintf`. Instead of assuming a fixed size for the `str` buffer, the fix uses the `packet->line[i].len` value to properly specify the length of the string to be copied.

Detailed description of the fix:
The vulnerable code in the `ndpi_check_http_header` function is using `snprintf` to copy the packet line string into a fixed-size buffer `str`. The fixed-size buffer has a size of 64 bytes, but the length of the packet line string is not properly taken into account. This can lead to a heap buffer overflow if the length of the string exceeds the size of the buffer.

To fix the vulnerability, the code is modified to use the length of the packet line string when calling `snprintf`. The code replaces the fixed-size format specifier in `snprintf` with `%.*s`, which takes an additional argument representing the length of the string. This ensures that only the specified length of the string is copied into the buffer, preventing a buffer overflow.

By making this correction in each case statement, the fix ensures that the `str` buffer is always large enough to hold the copied string and eliminates the possibility of a heap buffer overflow.
