Vulnerability:
Heap-buffer-overflow in CFF::Charset::collect_glyph_to_sid_map. This vulnerability could result in a heap buffer overflow when executing the `collect_glyph_to_sid_map` function in the `Charset1_2` struct.

Summary of the fix:
The fix for this vulnerability is to add a bounds check before entering the loop in the `collect_glyph_to_sid_map` function. If `gid` is greater than or equal to `num_glyphs`, the function will return early, preventing the heap buffer overflow.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the original code, there is no bounds check when initializing the `gid` variable before entering the loop in the `collect_glyph_to_sid_map` function. This means that if `gid` is greater than or equal to `num_glyphs`, the loop will continue to execute and potentially result in a heap buffer overflow.

The fix addresses this issue by adding a bounds check before entering the loop. If `gid` is greater than or equal to `num_glyphs`, the function will return early without executing the loop, effectively preventing the heap buffer overflow.

The updated code with the fix is as follows:

```cpp
void collect_glyph_to_sid_map (hb_map_t *mapping, unsigned int num_glyphs) const
{
  hb_codepoint_t gid = 1;
  if (gid >= num_glyphs)
    return;
  for (unsigned i = 0;; i++)
  {
    hb_codepoint_t sid = ranges[i].first;
    unsigned count = ranges[i].nLeft + 1;
    for (unsigned j = 0; j < count; j++)
      mapping->set (gid++, sid++);

    if (gid >= num_glyphs)
      break;
  }
}
```

This fix ensures that the `collect_glyph_to_sid_map` function will return early if `gid` is greater than or equal to `num_glyphs`, preventing any potential heap buffer overflow.
