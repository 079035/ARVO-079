Vulnerability: Stack Buffer Overflow

Summary of the Fix:
The fix for this vulnerability is to ensure that the channel count is checked after it has been set to avoid a stack buffer overflow. This patch rearranges the code to check the channel count only after it has been initialized.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
In the original code, the channel count was checked before it was initialized. This could result in a stack buffer overflow if the channel count exceeded the maximum allowed value. By rearranging the code, the channel count is now checked after it has been initialized, ensuring that the channel count is valid and preventing a stack buffer overflow.

In the fixed code, the channel count is first initialized using the channel mask. Then, after the channel count has been initialized, it is checked against the maximum allowed value (WMALL_MAX_CHANNELS). If the channel count exceeds the maximum value, a request for a sample with fewer channels is made.

This fix ensures that the channel count is checked only after it has been properly initialized, preventing a stack buffer overflow.
