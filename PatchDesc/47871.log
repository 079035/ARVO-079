Vulnerability: In the given diff file, the vulnerability being patched is the incomplete language mappings in the `mov_mdhd_language_map` table in the `libavformat/isom.c` file.

Summary of the Fix: The fix involves adding ISO 639 language codes to the `mov_mdhd_language_map` table for languages that were previously missing.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
1. Several languages were missing ISO 639 codes in the `mov_mdhd_language_map` table, causing incomplete language mappings.
2. To fix this, the developer added ISO 639 codes for the missing languages in the `mov_mdhd_language_map` table.
3. The added ISO 639 codes provide complete mappings between the numeric codes from the `mdhd` atom and the respective languages.
4. The added language mappings ensure accurate language identification and compatibility within the context of the codebase.
5. This fix addresses the issue reported in ticket #9743, where certain languages were missing ISO 639 mappings.
6. The fix is signed off by the author and is included in the commit with the given hash (58880a8ea8d1aa0497e88f0da4e88455db9ba723).
