Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that was patched in this diff file is related to generating test vectors. The `TestVectorFlat::GenerateVector` function in the `test_vector_types.cpp` file was using a fixed cardinality of 3 to generate values for different types of logical vectors. This fixed cardinality was causing issues when the number of values in a vector was less than 3. The vulnerability would cause incorrect test vectors to be generated when the cardinality was greater than the number of values in the vector, leading to potential test failures or incorrect behavior.

Summary of fix:
The fix implemented in this diff file was to introduce a constant `TEST_VECTOR_CARDINALITY` value in the `TestVectorFlat` struct and use it for generating test vectors. This fixed cardinality is set to 3 and ensures that the test vectors are generated correctly, even when the number of values in a vector is less than 3.

Detailed description of fix:
1. In the `TestVectorFlat` struct, a `TEST_VECTOR_CARDINALITY` constant is introduced and set to 3.
2. The `GenerateValues` function in the `TestVectorFlat` struct is modified. Instead of directly populating the `result` vector, it now returns the generated values as a vector.
3. The `Generate` function in the `TestVectorFlat` struct is modified to use the `GenerateValues` function to generate values for the test vectors.
4. Inside the `Generate` function, a loop is added to handle cases where the number of values is less than `TEST_VECTOR_CARDINALITY`. The loop iterates over the values and creates separate data chunks for each fixed cardinality of test vectors.
5. Each data chunk is initialized with the logical type of the test vector.
6. The values are then assigned to the data chunk using the `SetValue` function.
7. The cardinality of each data chunk is set appropriately based on the available number of values.
8. Finally, the generated data chunk is moved to the `entries` vector, which holds all the generated test vectors.

This fix ensures that the test vectors are generated correctly and consistently, regardless of the number of values in a vector.
