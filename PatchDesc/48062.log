Vulnerability:
In the file `test_vector_types.cpp`, there is a vulnerability related to generating test vectors for certain data types. Specifically, there is a discrepancy between the declaration of the `GenerateValues` function and its implementation, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

Summary of the fix:
The fix addresses the discrepancy between the declaration and implementation of the `GenerateValues` function. It also ensures that the test vectors are generated correctly for the specified data types.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The `GenerateValues` function is modified in the `TestVectorFlat` struct to return a vector of values instead of modifying the `result` vector directly.
2. The `Generate` function in the `TestVectorFlat` struct is updated to use the modified `GenerateValues` function and create a new `DataChunk` for each batch of values.
3. The `TestVectorConstant` struct is updated to use the modified `GenerateValues` function instead of directly modifying the `result` vector. The new approach ensures that the constant vector is generated correctly.
4. The `TestVectorSequence` struct is modified to skip generating values if the standard vector size is greater than 2. This change prevents invalid memory access when slicing the result chunk.
5. The `TestVectorDictionary` struct is updated to correctly slice the result chunk based on the `slice_entries` set. This ensures that the dictionary test vectors are generated correctly.

These changes address the vulnerability and maintain the expected behavior of generating test vectors for different data types.
