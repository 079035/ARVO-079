Vulnerability: The vulnerability fixed in this code is the improper handling of an IOException in the `decodeKodak65000` function. The code catches the IOException and sets an error message but continues execution, returning a partial result.

Summary of the fix: The fix removes the exception handling for the IOException. Now, if an IOException occurs during the decoding process, it will not be caught and the error message will not be set. This allows the IOException to propagate up the call stack and potentially be handled by higher-level code.

Detailed description of the fix: 

1. The `decodeKodak65000` function is called without the exception handling.
```
decodeKodak65000(&input, width, height);
```

By removing the `try` and `catch` block around the `decodeKodak65000` function call, the exception is no longer caught and handled within the function.

2. Previously, if an IOException occurred during the execution of `decodeKodak65000`, the code would catch the exception and set an error message using the `setError` function of `mRaw` object:
```cpp
mRaw->setError("IO error occurred while reading image. Returning partial result.");
```

With the removal of the exception handling, this error message will no longer be set. Any IOException that occurs will propagate up the call stack, allowing higher-level code to handle it appropriately.

Overall, the fix removes the unnecessary exception handling for the IOException in the `decodeKodak65000` function, allowing for better error handling and propagation of exceptions.
