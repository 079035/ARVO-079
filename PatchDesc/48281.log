Vulnerability:
There is an out of array access vulnerability in the code.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix checks if the width of the video is divisible by 8 in addition to the existing checks for buffer size and width.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
The fix modifies the conditional statement on line 61 to check if the width of the video is divisible by 8 using the modulus operator (%). If the width is not divisible by 8, the function returns AVERROR_INVALIDDATA, indicating an error. This additional check ensures that the width is a multiple of 8 and prevents out of array access.
