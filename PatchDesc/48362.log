Vulnerability:
The vulnerability patched in the given diff file is a potential null pointer dereference. In the original code, there was a missing check that caused the code to attempt to dereference a null pointer when the `len` parameter is zero.

Fix Summary:
The fix ensures that the `len` parameter is checked for zero before proceeding with the code execution. If the `len` parameter is zero, the function returns -1, indicating an error.

Detailed Fix Description:
The fix adds a condition in the if statement of the function to check if `len` is equal to zero. If `len` is zero, the function returns -1 immediately, indicating an error. This fix prevents the subsequent code from being executed when the `len` parameter is zero and avoids a potential null pointer dereference.

Here's the modified code from the fix:

```c
if (!str_var || !uri || len == 0)
  return -1;
```

By adding the `len == 0` condition in the if statement, the fix ensures that the code only continues execution when `len` is greater than zero, avoiding the null pointer dereference vulnerability.
