Vulnerability: The vulnerability in the given diff file is an out-of-bounds memory access when mapping coordinates in the `map_coords` function of the `avar` struct.

Summary of the Fix: The fix corrects the out-of-bounds memory access issue in the `map_coords` function.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
1. The `map_coords` function iterates through each coordinate in the `coords` array and maps it using the `map` function from the `SegmentMaps` struct.
2. In the fixed code, a check is added to ensure that the value of `count` (the number of coordinates to map) is not greater than `axisCount` (the number of variation axes in the font).
3. If `count` is less than `axisCount`, a loop is added to iterate over the remaining axes and update the `map` pointer accordingly.
4. The remaining code uses the updated `map` pointer to access the `v2` object and perform coordinate mapping.
5. The fixed code properly initializes the `out` vector and allocates memory for it using the `alloc` function.
6. The `for` loop now iterates over all coordinates, not just the first `count` coordinates, and performs the coordinate mapping operations.
7. The fixes include proper memory management by destroying the `var_store_cache` and freeing the memory allocated for the `out` vector using the `destroy_cache` and `free` functions, respectively.
8. Finally, the `coords` array is updated with the mapped values from the `out` vector.

Note: The patch file also includes an addition of a new file, which is not related to the vulnerability fix mentioned above.
