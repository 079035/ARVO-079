Vulnerability:
The vulnerability fixed in this code patch is a heap-buffer-overflow. The issue can be observed by the error message shown in the diff file:
```
==160665==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x604000000038 at pc 0x55f7250d9a5c bp 0x7fff02c82b90 sp 0x7fff02c82350
READ of size 4 at 0x604000000038 thread T0
```
The error occurs in the function `dissect_softether_ip_port` in the file "src/lib/protocols/softether.c" at line 303.

Fix Summary:
The fix for this vulnerability is to add checks to ensure that the `ip_port_separator` variable is correctly positioned within the payload and does not cause a buffer overflow. Two additional checks are inserted to verify that `ip_port_separator` is not less than the payload pointer plus the lengths of "IP=" and ",PORT=".

Detailed Fix:
The following changes were made to fix the vulnerability:

1. Addition of the following check after finding `ip_port_separator`:
```c
if (ip_port_separator < (char const *)packet->payload + NDPI_STATICSTRING_LEN("IP="))
{
  return 1;
}
```
This check ensures that `ip_port_separator` is not positioned before the beginning of the IP value.

2. Addition of the following check after finding `ip_len`:
```c
if (ip_port_separator < (char const *)packet->payload + NDPI_STATICSTRING_LEN("IP=") + NDPI_STATICSTRING_LEN(",PORT="))
{
  return 1;
}
```
This check ensures that `ip_port_separator` is not positioned before the end of the IP value and before the beginning of the port value.

These additional checks prevent the heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability by ensuring that the `ip_len` and `port_len` values are calculated correctly and do not exceed the boundaries of the corresponding buffers `flow->protos.softether.ip` and `flow->protos.softether.port`.
