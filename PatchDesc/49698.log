Vulnerability:
The vulnerability patched in this diff file is a potential out-of-bounds memory access issue. 

Summary of the Fix:
The fix addresses the memory boundary checks issue in the `internal_huf_decompress` function.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
The fix introduces a new variable `hufInfoBlockSize` which is set to `5 * sizeof(uint32_t)`. This variable represents the size of the header information in the compressed data. 

In the original code, the pointer `ptr` was initialized to `compressed + 20`, assuming that the header size is always 20 bytes. However, the fix replaces this hardcoded value with `hufInfoBlockSize`, making it a dynamic value based on the size of the header information.

The fix also modifies the condition for checking if there are enough bytes remaining in the buffer. It changes from `ptr + nBytes > compressed + nCompressed` to `hufInfoBlockSize + nBytes > nCompressed`. This new condition ensures that there are enough bytes remaining in the buffer after accounting for the header size.

Additionally, in the fast decoder section, the fix adds an extra check to ensure that there are `nBytes` remaining in the buffer before performing the fasthuf_decode. This check is `if ((uint64_t)(ptr - compressed) + nBytes > nCompressed)`.

These changes ensure that the function performs proper memory boundary checks and avoids potential out-of-bounds memory access issues.
