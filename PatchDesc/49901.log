Vulnerability: Heap-buffer overflow
Summary of the fix: The fix addresses a heap-buffer overflow issue caused by insufficient size validation of the payload in the `dissect_softether_type` function.
Detailed description of the fix: The fix includes adding a size validation check to ensure that the payload length is sufficient for the specified size. In the original code, the payload length is compared to `siz + 3` to determine if it is greater than or equal to the required size. However, this comparison does not take into account the possibility of overflow when calculating the total size (`(u_int64_t)siz + 3`). To fix this issue, the fix updates the comparison to cast the payload length to `u_int64_t` and compares it to `(u_int64_t)siz + 3` to prevent overflow. This ensures that the payload length is accurately validated to avoid a heap-buffer overflow.
