Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the provided diff file is an out of array access. Specifically, the code does not check the width of the video frame before accessing an array.

Fix Summary:
The fix in this commit is to add a check for the width of the video frame before accessing the array. If the width is less than 8 or not divisible by 8, the function returns an "AVERROR_INVALIDDATA" error.

Detailed Fix Description:
The fix in this commit is implemented in the function `speedhq_decode_frame()` in the file `libavcodec/speedhq.c`. In the original code, the width of the video frame is not checked before accessing an array. This can cause an out of array access if the width is less than 8.

To fix this vulnerability, the code is modified to add a check for the width of the video frame. If the width is less than 8 or not divisible by 8 (`avctx->width % 8 != 0`), the function returns an "AVERROR_INVALIDDATA" error. This ensures that the array is only accessed when the width meets the specified criteria, preventing out of array access.

Additionally, the fix also includes checks for other conditions such as the buffer size (`buf_size < 4`) and the quality value (`quality >= 100`). If any of these conditions are not met, the function also returns an "AVERROR_INVALIDDATA" error.

Overall, this fix ensures that the code performs the necessary checks on the input data before accessing arrays, preventing potential out of array access vulnerabilities.
