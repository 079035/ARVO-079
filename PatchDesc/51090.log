1. Vulnerability description:
The vulnerability in the code is that it is passing the incorrect string length to the function `get_utf_8_string()`. In both instances where `get_utf_8_string()` is called, the length parameter is set to `(int)strlen(key)` and `(int)strlen(value)` respectively. This can result in incorrect decoding of the form key and value, as the length calculated from the offsets may not be the same as the length of the string itself.

2. Fix summary:
The fix corrects the vulnerability by passing the correct length of the percent decoded string to the `get_utf_8_string()` function.

3. Fix description:
The fix involves modifying two lines in the code. The incorrect length parameters `(int)strlen(key)` and `(int)strlen(value)` are replaced with the length calculated from the offsets `(next_offset - offset)`. 

After the fix, the lines should be:
```
key_decoded = get_utf_8_string(pinfo->pool, key, next_offset - offset);
value_decoded = get_utf_8_string(pinfo->pool, value, next_offset - offset);
```

By passing in the correct length of the percent decoded string, the `get_utf_8_string()` function will be able to decode the strings correctly. This ensures that the form key and value are properly decoded and avoids any potential issues that could arise from incorrectly decoded strings.
