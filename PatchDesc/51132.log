Vulnerability:

The vulnerability in the code is a double-free issue. The code attempts to free the variable `tmp` twice, once before the `goto` statement at `line 202`, and again after the `goto` statement at `line 210`.

Summary of the fix:

The fix addresses the double-free issue by removing the unnecessary freeing of the variable `tmp` before the `goto` statement at `line 202`.

Detailed description of the fix:

To fix the double-free issue, the code at `line 191` should be updated as follows:

Before:
```c
flb_sds_destroy(tmp);
```

After:
```c
/* Remove the unnecessary freeing of tmp */
```

By removing the line `flb_sds_destroy(tmp);`, the issue of double-freeing `tmp` is resolved. Since `tmp` is already freed within the `if` statement at `line 198`, there is no need to free it again after the `goto` statement at `line 210`.

This fix ensures that the variable `tmp` is only freed once, preventing any potential double-free vulnerability.
