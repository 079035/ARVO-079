Vulnerability: Potential out-of-bounds read in PfxEntry::test_condition()

Summary of the fix: The fix introduces a check to ensure that the index `st` is within the bounds of the string `s` before accessing the character at that index.

Detailed description of the fix: The vulnerability in the code arises from the fact that the code does not correctly handle the situation where the index `st` exceeds the length of the string `s`. This can lead to accessing memory outside the bounds of the string, resulting in undefined behavior and potentially a crash or information leak.

To fix this vulnerability, a check is added to the code to verify if the index `st` is less than the size of the string `s` before trying to access the character at that index. If the index is out of bounds, the code returns 0, indicating that the word does not satisfy the condition.

This check prevents the code from accessing memory outside the boundaries of the string `s` and ensures that the behavior is well defined.
