Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that is patched in this diff file is the use of uninitialized value. 

Summary of the fix:
The fix involves using memory-safe functions (`memcpy`) instead of unsafe functions (`strcpy`) to copy the contents of a string.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the original code, the `strcpy` function is used to copy the contents of a string (`word->c_str()`) into a character array (`hpw`). This can lead to a buffer overflow if the length of the string exceeds the size of the character array. Additionally, `strcpy` does not guarantee null-termination of the destination string.

The fix involves replacing the `strcpy` function with the `memcpy` function. The `memcpy` function copies the specified number of bytes from the source to the destination, ensuring that the buffer size is not exceeded. After copying the string, a null character (`\0`) is manually added to ensure proper null-termination.

By using `memcpy` instead of `strcpy`, the fix avoids the risk of buffer overflow and ensures that the destination string is properly null-terminated, mitigating the use of uninitialized memory.

This fix improves the overall security and stability of the code by preventing potential memory errors.
