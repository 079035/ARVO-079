Vulnerability Description:
The vulnerability patched in this diff file is a double-free vulnerability. It occurs in the `sc_pkcs15_encode_df` function of the `pkcs15.c` file. The function is responsible for encoding a Data Field (DF) structure in PKCS15 format. It loops over the object list of the PKCS15 card and encodes the associated objects into a buffer. However, in the loop, if an error occurs during the encoding process, the function frees the `tmp` buffer and returns the error. But it forgets to set the `tmp` pointer to NULL after freeing it. As a result, when the loop continues, it attempts to free the `tmp` buffer again, leading to a double-free vulnerability.

Fix Summary:
The fix for this vulnerability involves setting the `tmp` pointer to NULL after freeing it. This prevents the double-free vulnerability by ensuring that the memory is not freed again in subsequent iterations of the loop.

Detailed Fix Description:
The fix is made in the `sc_pkcs15_encode_df` function by adding the line `tmp = NULL;` after the `free(tmp)` statement inside the loop. By setting the `tmp` pointer to NULL, it ensures that the memory is not freed again in subsequent iterations of the loop. This prevents the double-free vulnerability. Here is the modified code:

```c
for (obj = p15card->obj_list; obj != NULL; obj = obj->next) {
    if (obj->df != df)
        continue;
    r = func(ctx, obj, &tmp, &tmpsize);
    if (r) {
        free(tmp);
        free(buf);
        return r;
    }
    if (!tmpsize)
        continue;
    p = (u8 *) realloc(buf, bufsize + tmpsize);
    if (!p) {
        free(tmp);
        free(buf);
        return SC_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY;
    }
    buf = p;
    memcpy(buf + bufsize, tmp, tmpsize);
    free(tmp);
    tmp = NULL;
    bufsize += tmpsize;
}
```

After the fix, the `tmp` pointer is set to NULL after freeing it with `free(tmp)`. This ensures that the memory is not freed again in subsequent iterations, eliminating the double-free vulnerability.
