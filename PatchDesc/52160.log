Vulnerability:
Stack-buffer-overflow READ

Summary of the fix:
The fix in this commit addresses a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the `ndpi_check_http_server` function in the `http.c` file. 

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The fix introduces a new variable `off` to store the offset from the beginning of the server string.
2. The fix modifies the for loop condition that iterates over the server string to include additional checks to prevent reading beyond the bounds of the `buf` array.
3. The fix adds a new variable `msg` to store the error message string.
4. The fix moves the declaration of `msg` outside of the if-else block to prevent redeclaration.
5. The fix eliminates code duplication by removing the redundant declarations of `msg`.
6. The fix uses `snprintf` to safely format the error message into `msg`.
7. The fix uses `ndpi_set_risk` function to assign the error message to the flow's risk field.
8. The fix checks for the minimum version requirements and compares it with the parsed version from the server string.
9. The fix includes appropriate conditions to check for the correct `off` value and version number.
10. The fix addresses the vulnerability by preventing reading beyond the bounds of the `buf` array and properly handling the error message assignment.
