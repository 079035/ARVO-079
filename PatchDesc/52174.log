Vulnerability: Heap Buffer Overflow
Summary of the Fix: The fix in this commit addresses a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the IRC protocol implementation.
Detailed Description of the Fix:
1. The code first checks if the detected protocol stack is not equal to NDPI_PROTOCOL_IRC and the packet counter is less than 20, and the payload packet length is greater than or equal to 8.
2. If the condition is true, the code performs various checks and operations on the packet payload.
3. One of the checks is done on the packet payload where it checks for specific strings like "USER ", "NICK ", "PASS ", ":", and various others. If any of these strings are found, it extracts the part of the payload after the string and stores it in a buffer.
   - There is a vulnerability here where the snprintf() function is used to copy the extracted payload into a fixed-sized buffer without checking
