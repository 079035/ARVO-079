Vulnerability: Division by zero

Summary of the fix: The fix addresses a possible division by zero by introducing a check for a delta value being equal to zero before performing any calculations.

Detailed description of the fix: In the code, the variable `delta` is calculated as the difference between the last and first time values of a key. The code then performs operations using this `delta` value. However, there is a vulnerability where the code does not check if the `delta` value is zero before performing these operations. This could lead to a division by zero.

The fix introduces a check for a zero delta value using the condition `if (delta == 0.0)` and if the condition is true, the code continues to the next iteration of the loop using the `continue` statement. This prevents further calculations and operations from being performed, avoiding a potential division-by-zero error.

By adding this check, the code ensures that the division operation is only carried out when the `delta` value is non-zero, preventing any division-by-zero errors and enhancing the robustness of the code.
