1. Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code is an out-of-bounds read. This occurs when the code tries to access memory beyond the allocated size. In this case, the vulnerability is in the calculation of the column index for the raw image data. The code does not properly check if the calculated column index is within the bounds of the raw image width.

2. Short Summary of the Fix:
The fix adds an additional check to ensure that the calculated column index, when added to the left margin, is less than the raw image width. This prevents the code from trying to access data beyond the allocated memory for the raw image.

3. Detailed Description of the Fix:
The fix is applied in the section of the code that handles the rotation of Fuji images. In the original code, the column index `c` is calculated based on the row and column indices of the raw image. However, there is no check to ensure that `c` is within the bounds of the raw image width. The fix adds this check by modifying the if condition from `if (r < S.height && c < S.width)` to `if (r < S.height && c < S.width && col + int(S.left_margin) < int(S.raw_width))`. This ensures that the column index, when added to the left margin, is less than the raw image width, preventing an out-of-bounds read.
