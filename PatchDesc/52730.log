Vulnerability:
- The code does not perform a boundary check when decoding a symbol.
- If the `codeLen` is `LONG_ZEROCODE_RUN`, the code attempts to read 8 more bits from `currByte`, but it does not check if `currByte` is already beyond the valid boundary.

Fix Summary:
- The fix adds a boundary check before attempting to read the additional 8 bits when `codeLen` is `LONG_ZEROCODE_RUN`.
- If `currByte` is already beyond the valid boundary, the code returns an error.

Detailed Fix Description:
1. After the check for `codeLen == (uint64_t) LONG_ZEROCODE_RUN`, the fix adds the following code:
   ```
   if (currByte >= topByte)
   {
       if (pctxt)
           pctxt->print_error (
               pctxt,
               EXR_ERR_CORRUPT_CHUNK,
               "Error decoding Huffman table (Truncated table data).");
       return EXR_ERR_CORRUPT_CHUNK;
   }
   ```
   - This block checks if `currByte` is already beyond the valid boundary of `table`.
   - If `currByte` is beyond the valid boundary, it means that the table data is truncated, and an error is returned.

2. In the block where `symbol` is updated when `codeLen == (uint64_t) LONG_ZEROCODE_RUN`, the fix adds the following code:
   ```
   symbol +=
       fasthuf_read_bits (8, &currBits, &currBitCount, &currByte) +
       SHORTEST_LONG_RUN - 1;
   ```
   - This block reads an additional 8 bits from `currByte` to calculate the updated value of `symbol`.
   - The value read from `currByte` is added to `symbol`.
   - The `SHORTEST_LONG_RUN - 1` term adjusts the value of `symbol` so that it corresponds to the correct position in the symbol table.

3. The fix also removes unnecessary comments and reorganizes some variable declarations for clarity, but these changes do not affect the behavior of the code.
