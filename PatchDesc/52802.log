Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is that there is no check for the size of the allocated memory when loading a Kodak thumbnail. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the estimated data size is too small.

Summary of fix:
The fix prevents the allocation of too small memory by checking the estimated data size before allocating memory for the Kodak thumbnail.

Detailed description of fix:
1. The code now checks the estimated data size of the thumbnail using the formulas T.theight * T.twidth / 3 and INT64(T.theight) * INT64(T.twidth) before allocating memory for the thumbnail.
2. If ID.toffset is less than 0, an exception LIBRAW_EXCEPTION_IO_CORRUPT is thrown, indicating that the input data is corrupt.
3. If ID.toffset + est_datasize is greater than ID.input->size() + THUMB_READ_BEYOND, an exception LIBRAW_EXCEPTION_IO_EOF is thrown, indicating that the input data exceeds the expected size.
4. If INT64(T.theight) * INT64(T.twidth) is greater than 1024ULL * 1024ULL * LIBRAW_MAX_THUMBNAIL_MB, an exception LIBRAW_EXCEPTION_IO_CORRUPT is thrown, indicating that the thumbnail size exceeds the maximum allowed size.
5. If INT64(T.theight) * INT64(T.twidth) is less than 64ULL, an exception LIBRAW_EXCEPTION_IO_CORRUPT is thrown, indicating that the thumbnail size is too small.
6. If T.twidth is less than 16, T.twidth is greater than 8192, T.theight is less than 16, or T.theight is greater than 8192, an exception LIBRAW_EXCEPTION_IO_CORRUPT is thrown, indicating that the thumbnail dimensions are invalid.
