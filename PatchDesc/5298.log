Vulnerability:
- The vulnerability in the given code patch is a buffer overflow. The variable `ieee1905_reporting_policy_flags` is an array of pointers that is used to pass as argument to the `proto_tree_add_bitmask_with_flags` function. However, the array is missing the NULL terminator. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read during the execution of the `proto_tree_add_bitmask_with_flags` function, potentially resulting in a crash or information leak.

Fix Summary:
- The fix adds a NULL terminator at the end of the `ieee1905_reporting_policy_flags` array.

Detailed Fix Description:
1. Initialize the `ieee1905_reporting_policy_flags` array with the required memory addresses.
```c
static const int *ieee1905_reporting_policy_flags[] = {
    &hf_ieee1905_assoc_sta_traffic_stats_inclusion,
    &hf_ieee1905_assoc_sta_link_metrics_inclusion,
    &hf_ieee1905_reporting_policy_flags_reserved,
    NULL
};
```
2. The added NULL terminator ensures that the `proto_tree_add_bitmask_with_flags` function stops reading the array after processing all the valid elements and avoids accessing out-of-bounds memory.
3. This fix prevents the buffer overflow vulnerability and ensures proper handling of the `ieee1905_reporting_policy_flags` array.
