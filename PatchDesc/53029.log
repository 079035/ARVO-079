Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is that the code has a wrong reference to the prescaler in the uart_init function.

Summary of Fix:
The fix updates the calculation of the uart->BRR value to correctly use the APBx prescaler value.

Detailed Description of Fix:
1. Previously, the code wrongly used the APB2 prescaler in the calculation of uart->BRR.
2. The fix updates the calculation to use the APBx prescaler instead.
3. The APBx prescaler value is set to 4 in the updated calculation.
4. The fix also includes a TODO comment to make the APBx prescaler configurable in the future.
5. As a result of the fix, the uart->BRR value is correctly calculated based on the correct prescaler value.
