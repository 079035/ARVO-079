Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that could be patched in this diff file is that the script is assuming that the `sha256sum` command is always available. If the `sha256sum` command is not available on the system, the script will fail.

Summary of the fix:
The fix adds a check to see if the `sha256sum` command is available. If it is available, the `sha256sum` command is used. If it is not available, the `shasum` command with the `-a 256` option is used instead.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The existing line `SHASUM=${SHASUM:-sha256sum}` is replaced with the following code:
   ```
   if [ $(which sha256sum) ] ; then
     SHASUM=${SHASUM:-sha256sum}
   else
     SHASUM=${SHASUM:-shasum -a 256}
   fi
   ```
   - The `$(which sha256sum)` command checks if the `sha256sum` command is available by searching for its executable path.
   - If the `sha256sum` command is available, it is assigned to the `SHASUM` variable.
   - If the `sha256sum` command is not available, the `shasum -a 256` command is assigned to the `SHASUM` variable. The `-a 256` option specifies the algorithm to use as SHA-256.
2. The script then continues to use the `SHASUM` variable to calculate the hash of the downloaded archive, ensuring compatibility with both `sha256sum` and `shasum -a 256`.

This fix allows the script to work on systems where the `sha256sum` command is not available, by falling back to using the `shasum` command with the `-a 256` option.
