Vulnerability:
The vulnerability addressed in this patch is a potential buffer overflow in the `uncompressed_fp_dng_load_raw` function in the file `fp_dng.cpp`. 

Summary of the fix:
The fix adds a check for the validity of `bytesps` before allocating memory. If `bytesps` is less than 1 or greater than 4, an exception is thrown, preventing a potential buffer overflow.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. The patch adds the following code at line 23:
```c
if(bytesps < 1 || bytesps > 4)
    throw LIBRAW_EXCEPTION_DECODE_RAW;
```
This code checks if `bytesps`, the number of bytes per sample, is less than 1 or greater than 4.
If `bytesps` is not within the valid range, it throws an exception, `LIBRAW_EXCEPTION_DECODE_RAW`, which indicates a decoding error occurred while reading the RAW data.

2. Before the fix, `bytesps` was calculated as `(ifd->bps + 7) >> 3`.
The expression `(ifd->bps + 7)` rounds up `ifd->bps` to the nearest multiple of 8, and `>> 3` is a bitwise right shift by 3, which is equivalent to dividing by 8.
This calculation ensures that `bytesps` is the number of bytes required to store a sample based on the number of bits per sample (`ifd->bps`).

3. By checking if `bytesps` is within the valid range of 1 to 4, the fix prevents potential buffer overflow issues in the subsequent code that relies on the correct number of bytes for each sample.

4. If the check fails and an exception is thrown, the function `uncompressed_fp_dng_load_raw` will not proceed further, and the decoding process will be terminated.
