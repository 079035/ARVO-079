Vulnerability: Arbitrary Image Size

Summary of Fix: The fix limits the maximum width and height of the image to 2048 pixels.

Detailed Description of Fix:
1. In the diff file, the fix is made in the `utils.cc` file.
2. The vulnerable code is at line 8 and 9, where the width and height of the image are not limited.
3. The fix is made at line 12 and 13, where the `Magick::ResourceLimits::width()` and `Magick::ResourceLimits::height()` functions are called to set the maximum width and height of the image to 2048 pixels, respectively.
4. By limiting the image size, the potential vulnerability of processing images with very large width or height is mitigated.
5. This fix ensures that any images with a width or height greater than 2048 pixels will not be processed, reducing the risk of resource exhaustion or other potential security issues.
