1. Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code before the patch was that the function `IsBlobSeekable` did not handle the case when the blob type was `ZipStream` and the build did not link zlib. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior or crashes if the function was called with a `ZipStream` blob in a build without zlib.

2. Short Summary of the Fix:
The fix adds a preprocessor conditional that checks if zlib is linked (`MAGICKCORE_ZLIB_DELEGATE` is defined). If zlib is not linked, the function will now simply break out of the switch statement and return `MagickFalse`, indicating that the blob is not seekable.

3. Detailed Description of the Fix:
In the `IsBlobSeekable` function, a switch statement is used to handle different blob types. For the `ZipStream` case, the original code assumed that zlib was always linked and directly used the `gzseek` function from zlib. This could cause problems if zlib was not linked.

The fix adds a preprocessor conditional `#if defined(MAGICKCORE_ZLIB_DELEGATE)` before the `ZipStream` case. If zlib is linked (`MAGICKCORE_ZLIB_DELEGATE` is defined), the code inside the conditional will be compiled and the function will behave as before. If zlib is not linked, the code inside the conditional will not be compiled. Instead, the `break` statement after the `#else` will be compiled. This will cause the function to break out of the switch statement and return `MagickFalse`, indicating that the blob is not seekable. This prevents potential undefined behavior or crashes when the function is called with a `ZipStream` blob in a build without zlib.
