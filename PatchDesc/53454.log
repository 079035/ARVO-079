Vulnerability:

The vulnerability patched in this diff file is an out-of-bounds access issue.

Summary of the fix:

The fix checks the number of metadata blocks before adding a new block. If the number of metadata blocks is less than the maximum allowed number, the new block is added. Otherwise, the new block is not added.

Detailed description of the fix:

1. The fix adds a new constant `MAX_NUM_METADATA_BLOCKS` with a value of 2048, representing the maximum number of metadata blocks allowed.

2. In the `FuzzerDecoder` class, the declaration of the `metadata_blocks` array is updated to use the `MAX_NUM_METADATA_BLOCKS` constant as the size of the array.

3. The `num_metadata_blocks` variable is initialized to 0.

4. In the `metadata_callback` function, before adding a new metadata block, a check is performed to ensure that the number of metadata blocks is less than `MAX_NUM_METADATA_BLOCKS`.

5. If the check passes, the new metadata block is added to the `metadata_blocks` array and the `num_metadata_blocks` variable is incremented.

6. If the check fails, the new metadata block is not added.

The fix prevents an out-of-bounds access vulnerability by ensuring that the number of metadata blocks stays within the allowed limit.
