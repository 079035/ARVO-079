Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is that the `destroy_all()` function in the `UniformBumpAllocator` class does not correctly calculate the `end_offset` for destroying objects. This can lead to attempting to delete a nonexistent object under certain input sizes.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix addresses the issue by taking the bump-allocated chunk header into account when calculating the `end_offset` in the `destroy_all()` function of the `UniformBumpAllocator` class.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
1. Previously, the code allowed the `end_offset` to be larger than the chunk itself. This could cause the logic to attempt to delete a nonexistent object.
2. The fix modifies the calculation of the `end_offset` by subtracting the size of the `typename Allocator::ChunkHeader` from the `base_ptr + this->m_chunk_size - chunk`.
3. This ensures that the `end_offset` is correctly calculated and does not exceed the size of the chunk.
4. By considering the bump-allocated chunk header, the code ensures that objects within the allocated chunk are properly destroyed without attempting to delete nonexistent objects.
5. The fix resolves the vulnerability and prevents potential issues when deallocating and destroying objects in the `UniformBumpAllocator` class.
