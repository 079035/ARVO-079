Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is an invalid write in the function `SetQuantumDepth()`. Specifically, the line `extent=4*MagickMax(image->columns,image->rows)*quantum;` is writing beyond the allocated memory for the quantum pixel buffer.

Summary of Fix:
The fix eliminates the invalid write by correctly calculating the extent of the quantum pixel buffer.

Detailed Description of Fix:
In the original code, the extent of the quantum pixel buffer is calculated as `extent=4*MagickMax(image->columns,image->rows)*quantum;`. However, this calculation does not account for the actual depth of the quantum. 

The fix involves modifying the calculation to correctly account for the quantum depth. It checks the value of `quantum_info->depth` and sets it to a valid value if it exceeds certain limits. Then, it recalculates the extent using the corrected depth.

Specifically, the code snippet `extent=4*MagickMax(image->columns,image->rows)*quantum;` is replaced with:
```
    if (quantum_info->depth > 32)
       quantum_info->depth=64;
    else
       if (quantum_info->depth > 16)
         quantum_info->depth=32;
       else
         quantum_info->depth=16;
    
    quantum=(quantum_info->pad+MaxPixelChannels)*(quantum_info->depth+7)/8;
    extent=MagickMax(image->columns,image->rows)*quantum;
```

This fix ensures that the extent calculation is done correctly and prevents the invalid write vulnerability.
