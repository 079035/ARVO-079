Vulnerability: Incorrect adaptation of mode/partition probability counts

Summary of Fix: The fix corrects the adaptation of mode/partition probability counts in the LibVideo/VP9 decoder.

Detailed Description of Fix:
In the original code, there are incorrect calls to the `ADAPT_TREE` macro that leads to the adaptation of mode/partition probability counts being done using incorrect context values. This can result in incorrect probability values, which can affect the decoding process.

The fix updates the calls to the `ADAPT_TREE` macro with correct context values. The adaptation for `intra_mode`, `uv_mode`, and `partition` is now done using the correct context values `BLOCK_SIZE_GROUPS`, `INTRA_MODES`, and `PARTITION_CONTEXTS`, respectively. This ensures that the mode/partition probability counts are adapted correctly based on the appropriate contexts.

Additionally, the fix also performs some adaptations for other probability tables and counts in the code.

These updates ensure that the mode/partition probability counts are correctly adapted, improving the accuracy of the LibVideo/VP9 decoder.
