Vulnerability: Invalid NALU type in vvcC - ignoring

Summary of Fix: The fix for the vulnerability is to add a check to validate the NALU type before further processing. Invalid NALU types are ignored.

Detailed Description of Fix: 
1. Before the fix, the code would output a warning message for invalid NALU types in vvcC and continue processing. This could lead to potential issues if the invalid NALU types are supposed to be handled differently.

2. The fix adds a check to validate the NALU type. If the NALU type is invalid, a warning message is logged and the code skips further processing of the invalid NALU.

3. The modified code now checks for the validity of the NALU type before checking the nalucount and processing the NALUs.

4. This fix ensures that only valid NALU types are processed, improving the overall reliability and stability of the code.
