Vulnerability:

The vulnerability in the given diff file is a potential buffer overflow in the function `msc_partial_update_object`. The `msc_partial_update_object` function takes as input an `offset` and `dataLength` parameters. The `dataLength` parameter is used to calculate the length of the `apdu` data packet, which is then copied into the `buffer` array. However, there is no check performed to ensure that the addition of `dataLength` and `9` (the size of the fixed header) does not exceed the size of the `buffer`. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `dataLength` is too large.

Summary of the fix:

The fix in the given diff file is to add a check to ensure that `dataLength + 9` does not exceed the maximum size of the `buffer`. If the check fails, the function returns an `SC_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENTS` error code, indicating that the input arguments are invalid.

Detailed description of the fix:

The fix in the given diff file adds the following lines of code at the beginning of the `msc_partial_update_object` function:

```c
if (dataLength + 9 > MSC_MAX_APDU)
    return SC_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENTS;
```

This code checks if the sum of `dataLength` and `9` exceeds the maximum size of the `buffer` (`MSC_MAX_APDU`). If the check fails, indicating that the input argument is invalid and will cause a buffer overflow, the function immediately returns an error code `SC_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENTS`.

By adding this check, the fix ensures that the buffer overflow condition is prevented, keeping the code safe from potential exploits.
