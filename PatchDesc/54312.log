1. Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the original code is a potential buffer overflow. The function `msc_partial_update_object` copies data into a buffer without checking if the size of the data exceeds the buffer's capacity. This could lead to a buffer overflow if `dataLength + 9` is greater than `MSC_MAX_APDU`, the size of the buffer.

2. Short Summary of the Fix:
The fix adds a check to ensure that the size of the data to be copied into the buffer, plus an additional 9 bytes, does not exceed the size of the buffer. If the size does exceed the buffer's capacity, the function returns an error.

3. Detailed Description of the Fix:
The fix introduces a new condition at the beginning of the `msc_partial_update_object` function. This condition checks if `dataLength + 9` is greater than `MSC_MAX_APDU`. If this condition is true, the function immediately returns `SC_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENTS`, indicating that the arguments provided to the function are invalid. This prevents the function from attempting to copy more data into the buffer than it can hold, thus preventing a potential buffer overflow. The number 9 is added to `dataLength` because the function copies `dataLength` bytes of data into the buffer, but also writes additional data to the buffer before this, which takes up 9 bytes.
