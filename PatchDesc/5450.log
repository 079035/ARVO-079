Vulnerability:
The code in the diff file is susceptible to out-of-bounds writes when calculating the offset for `imbuf`. This occurs in the loop where it assigns the color index value to `imbuf`: `imbuf[imsx * (posision_y + i) + posision_x] = color_index;`. If the calculated offset is greater than or equal to the size of `imbuf` (imsx * imsy), it will result in an out-of-bounds write.

Summary of the fix:
The fix in the diff file adds additional checks to avoid the out-of-bounds writes.

Detailed description of the fix:
The fix includes the following changes:
1. A new variable `offset` of type `size_t` is added.
2. Before writing the color index to `imbuf`, it checks if the calculated offset is greater than or equal to `imsx * imsy`. If it is, the function will return `MagickFalse`.
3. If the check passes, the color index is assigned to `imbuf` at the calculated offset.
4. Similar checks are added when resetting the memory in the loop where repeat_count is greater than 1.
5. The function returns `MagickFalse` if the offset plus repeat_count is greater than or equal to `imsx * imsy`.

These checks ensure that the calculated offset for `imbuf` is always within the bounds of the allocated memory, preventing out-of-bounds writes.
