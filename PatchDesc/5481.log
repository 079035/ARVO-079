Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the provided diff file is a potential integer overflow in the `number_stitches` variable. This variable is initially set to 64 and is incremented by multiplying it by 2 when it exceeds its maximum value. However, there is no check to ensure that the multiplication does not cause an integer overflow, which could lead to undefined behavior.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix corrects the integer overflow issue by adding a check before multiplying the `number_stitches` variable by 2. If the multiplication would cause an overflow, the code throws a "MemoryAllocationFailed" exception instead of incrementing the variable.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
In the `ReadPESImage` function, after reading the stitches from the image, the code checks if the current number of stitches (`number_stitches`) has exceeded its limit by comparing it with the maximum value (`ssize_t`). If the limit is reached or exceeded, the code throws a "MemoryAllocationFailed" exception using the `ThrowReaderException` function. This prevents an integer overflow from occurring and ensures the program does not continue executing with potentially corrupted memory.

Here is the relevant code snippet showcasing the fix:

```diff
  if (i >= (ssize_t) number_stitches)
    {
      /*
        Make room for more stitches.
      */
      number_stitches<<=1;
      stitches=(PointInfo *)  ResizeQuantumMemory(stitches,(size_t)
        number_stitches,sizeof(*stitches));
      if (stitches == (PointInfo *) NULL)
        ThrowReaderException(ResourceLimitError,"MemoryAllocationFailed");
   }
```

This fix ensures that the `number_stitches` variable is correctly incremented without the risk of an integer overflow.
