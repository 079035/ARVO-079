Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that could be patched in the given diff file is that the image maximum width and height are not restricted, which may lead to potential memory overflows and security issues.

Summary of Fix:
The fix limits the image maximum width and height to 2048 pixels.

Detailed Description of Fix:
In the diff file, a new fix is added in the `FuzzingLimits` class constructor. The `Magick::ResourceLimits::width(2048)` and `Magick::ResourceLimits::height(2048)` functions are called to limit the image maximum width and height to 2048 pixels.

By setting these resource limits, the code ensures that any image processed by the `Magick++` library will not exceed the specified width and height. This prevents potential memory overflows and security issues that could occur when processing large images.

With this fix, the maximum width and height of any image processed by the library are restricted to 2048 pixels, providing a safeguard against potential vulnerabilities related to image size.
