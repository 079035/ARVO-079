Vulnerability: 
The vulnerability patched in this diff file is a memory management issue. 

Summary of Fix: 
The fix involves replacing the `memcpy` function with the `tvb_memcpy` function and fixing the condition in the while loop.

Detailed Description of Fix: 
1. The `memcpy` function is replaced with `tvb_memcpy`. The `tvb_memcpy` function is a safer alternative to `memcpy` in the context of a tvb (TV Buffer) object.
   - Line 199: `ts_frame[0] = 0x47;`
   - Line 200: `tvb_memcpy(tvb, ts_frame + 1, offset, 187);`

2. The condition in the while loop is fixed to decrement `numts` before checking the condition.
   - Line 208: `while (--numts) {`

These changes improve memory management and fix potential vulnerabilities related to memory operations.
