Vulnerability Description:
In the given diff file, the vulnerability being patched is an integer overflow. Specifically, an integer overflow occurs when calculating the value of the `end` variable in the `fx_TypedArray` function.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix for the vulnerability involves replacing the line that calculates the `end` variable with a function call to `fxAddChunkSizes`, which correctly handles the calculation without triggering an integer overflow.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
The fix involves replacing the following line of code:
```c
txInteger end = offset + delta;
```
with the following line of code:
```c
txInteger end = fxAddChunkSizes(the, offset, delta);
```

The `fxAddChunkSizes` function is a utility function that correctly calculates the sum of two values, taking into account potential overflow conditions. By using this function instead of the simple addition, the fix ensures that the integer overflow vulnerability is patched and a correct result is obtained.

Overall, this fix prevents the possibility of integer overflow when calculating the value of `end`, ensuring the correctness and security of the code.
