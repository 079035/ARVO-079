Vulnerability:
There is a vulnerability in the code where the if condition `(x + i) < (ssize_t) image->columns && (y + j) < (ssize_t) image->rows` is checking the dimensions of the image incorrectly. This leads to an out-of-bounds write in the pixel buffer when the condition is true.

Summary of fix:
The fix for the vulnerability is to correct the if condition to check the dimensions of the image correctly. The dimensions should be checked against `image->columns` for the x-coordinate and `image->rows` for the y-coordinate.

Detailed description of fix:
In the `ReadDXT3Pixels` function, there is a loop that reads a 4x4 patch of pixels from the image and writes them to the pixel buffer. Before writing each pixel, the code checks if the coordinates `(x + i)` and `(y + j)` are within the bounds of the image. However, the condition is currently checking against the wrong dimensions.

To fix the vulnerability, the condition in the if statement should be changed to `(x + i) < (ssize_t) image->columns && (y + j) < (ssize_t) image->rows`. This corrects the check for both x and y coordinates, ensuring that they are within the image boundaries.

The corrected code should look like this:

```
if ((x + i) < (ssize_t) image->columns && (y + j) < (ssize_t) image->rows)
```

With this fix, the pixel buffer will no longer be overflowed, preventing the vulnerability.
