Vulnerability:
There is a vulnerability in the code that can potentially lead to a buffer overflow.

Summary of Fix:
The fix prevents the buffer overflow by correcting the condition to check the bounds of the image.

Detailed Description of Fix:
In the original code, there is a condition that checks if the current pixel position is within the bounds of the image before writing the pixel values. However, the condition is incorrect, as it checks `(x + i) < (ssize_t) image->rows` instead of `(x + i) < (ssize_t) image->columns`. This means that the pixel position is being checked against the rows instead of the columns, leading to incorrect bounds checking and potentially allowing a buffer overflow.

The fix updates the condition to check `(x + i) < (ssize_t) image->columns`, ensuring that the bounds checking is done correctly against the image's columns. This prevents any out-of-bounds access and avoids a buffer overflow vulnerability.

This patch was applied by modifying the line:
```c
if ((x + i) < (ssize_t) image->rows && (y + j) < (ssize_t) image->columns)
```
to:
```c
if ((x + i) < (ssize_t) image->columns && (y + j) < (ssize_t) image->rows)
```
This fix ensures that the pixel positions are checked against the correct image dimensions, preventing any potential buffer overflow.
