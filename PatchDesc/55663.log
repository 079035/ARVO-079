Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is a memory leak or crash on invalid documents in the GMLHandler class of the code.

Summary of Fix:
The fix addresses the memory leak or crash issue by making several changes.

Detailed Description of Fix:
1. The variable "m_nGeometryDepth" is reset to 0 at the start of the "endElementGeometry()" function.
2. The array "apsXMLNode" is checked to ensure its size is equal to 2 before accessing the last element in the array using the "apsXMLNode.back()" function. This is done to avoid potential out-of-bounds access and ensure the validity of the "psInterestNode" pointer.
3. The "psInterestNode" pointer is checked against different conditions depending on the value of "eAppSchemaType" (an enumeration variable). If the conditions are met, certain modifications are made to the "pszValue" member of the "psInterestNode" node, including freeing the existing value and assigning a new value using "CPLStrdup()".
4. If the "psInterestNode" is equal to "BoundingBox", additional modifications are made to its child nodes, updating the "pszValue" member and other attributes.
5. Depending on the value of "stateStack[nStackDepth]", different actions are taken. If it is equal to "STATE_BOUNDED_BY_IN_FEATURE", the "psInterestNode" is either destroyed or set as the bounded by geometry of the GMLFeature object. Otherwise, the "psInterestNode" is added as a geometry to the GMLFeature object.
6. If "m_poReader->FetchAllGeometries()" returns true, the "psInterestNode" is added as a geometry to the GMLFeature object. Otherwise, the "psInterestNode" is set as the geometry directly if there is only one geometry property, otherwise, it is set as the geometry at the specified index.

This fix ensures proper handling of the "psInterestNode" and prevents memory leaks or crashes on invalid documents.
