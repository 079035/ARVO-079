Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is an ASN.1 encoding error in the `encode_mse_cdata` function in the `sm-eac.c` file. Specifically, the "Cryptographic mechanism reference" field is not marked as optional in the ASN.1 definition, causing an encoding error when this field is not present.

Summary of the fix:
The fix marks the "Cryptographic mechanism reference" field as optional in the ASN.1 definition, allowing the code to handle cases where this field is not present.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. In the `encode_mse_cdata` function, the `capdu_eac_mse` array defines the ASN.1 entries for the MSE:Set AT command data.
2. The vulnerability is addressed by modifying the first entry in `capdu_eac_mse` for the "Cryptographic mechanism reference" field.
3. In the original code, this field is defined without the `SC_ASN1_OPTIONAL` flag, indicating that it is a mandatory field.
4. The fix adds the `SC_ASN1_OPTIONAL` flag to the definition of the "Cryptographic mechanism reference" field, making it optional.
5. This allows the code to handle cases where this field is not present during encoding, preventing an encoding error.
6. The fix also includes necessary modifications to the subsequent `sc_format_asn1_entry` calls to ensure the correct encoding of other fields.
7. The rest of the code remains unchanged and is responsible for encoding other fields, appending the encoded data to `cdata`, and returning the length of the encoded data.
