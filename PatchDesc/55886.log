Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that is patched in this diff file is a potential crash on startup when using a mixed configuration of default and non-default listeners.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix ensures that the configuration supports mixed default/non-default listeners without causing a crash on startup.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
1. The code first initializes a variable `def_listener` to -1.
2. It then checks if the `config->default_listener` is set.
3. If `config->default_listener` is set, the code iterates through each listener in the `config->listeners` array and checks if it matches the default listener.
4. If a match is found, the index of the default listener in the `config->listeners` array is stored in the `def_listener` variable.
5. Next, the code increments the `config->listener_count` to account for the new listener that will be added.
6. The code then reallocates memory for the `config->listeners` array to accommodate the increased number of listeners.
7. If the reallocation fails due to insufficient memory, an error message is logged, and the function returns `MOSQ_ERR_NOMEM` to indicate the failure.
8. Once the memory allocation is successful, the code accesses the newly added listener by setting the `listener` pointer to point to the last element in the `config->listeners` array.
9. The `listener` structure is then zero-initialized to ensure all its members are properly initialized.
10. Memory is allocated for the `listener->security_options` structure and zero-initialized.
11. If the memory allocation for `listener->security_options` fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns `MOSQ_ERR_NOMEM`.
12. Finally, if `def_listener` is not equal to -1, it means a default listener was found in the previous step. The code then assigns the pointer to the default listener in the `config->listeners` array to `config->default_listener`.
13. The function returns `MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS` to indicate that the listener addition was successful.
