Vulnerability: Uninitialized value

Summary of Fix: The fix eliminates the use of an uninitialized value in the code.

Detailed Description of Fix: 
- The fix adds a line of code `(void) ResetMagickMemory(&pdb_info,0,sizeof(pdb_info));` right after the `Determine if this a PDB image file` comment. 
  This line of code resets (initializes) the memory of the `pdb_info` structure to zero, ensuring that all fields in the structure are properly initialized before being used.
  Before the fix, the `pdb_info` structure could contain uninitialized values, leading to undefined behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
- By initializing the structure to zero, the fix ensures that the fields of `pdb_info` have predictable values, which prevents any issues caused by accessing uninitialized memory.

Overall, the fix eliminates the uninitialized value vulnerability by properly initializing the `pdb_info` structure.
