1. Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code was a buffer overflow issue. The buffer for non-VCL (Video Coding Layer) NAL (Network Abstraction Layer) units was being filled up to its maximum size, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the incoming data exceeded the buffer size.

2. Short Summary of the Fix:
The fix involves limiting the amount of data that can be written into the non-VCL NAL buffer to 85% of its maximum size. This leaves a 15% buffer space to handle error cases and prevent buffer overflow.

3. Detailed Description of the Fix:
In the function `isvcd_pic_reset_ctxt`, the buffer size for non-VCL NAL units was originally set to `MAX_NON_VCL_NAL_BUFF_SIZE`. This was changed to `MAX_NON_VCL_NAL_BUFF_SIZE * 0.85`, effectively reducing the amount of data that can be written into the buffer to 85% of its maximum size. This change was made to leave a 15% buffer space to handle error cases and prevent buffer overflow. The buffer pointer is then updated with the new buffer size. This change helps to prevent a potential buffer overflow vulnerability by ensuring that the buffer is never completely filled, leaving some space to accommodate any unexpected additional data.
