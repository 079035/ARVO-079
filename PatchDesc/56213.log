Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is that the "sc_hsm_write_ef" function is not correctly handling the offset into the buffer and the offset into the card's file. The "file_offset" is not being updated correctly, which can lead to incorrect data being written to the card.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix in the given diff file separates the offset into the card's file ("file_offset") from the offset into the buffer ("offset"). This ensures that the correct data is read from the buffer and written to the card's file.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
1. The code adds a new variable "file_offset" initialized with the value of "idx". This "file_offset" will be used to keep track of the offset into the card's file.
2. Inside the loop, the code updates the "file_offset" variable by adding the value of "to_send". This ensures that the correct offset is used for subsequent data blocks.
3. Previously, the "offset" variable was used to copy data from the buffer to the APDU command. Now, the code uses "buf+offset" to calculate the correct offset in the buffer. This ensures that the correct data block is copied to the APDU command.
4. These changes ensure that the correct offset is used for both the buffer and the card's file, resulting in the correct data being written to the card.
