Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Summary of the fix: The fix protects against potential integer overflow in the `if` condition by adding an additional check.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. In the original code, there is a check to ensure that the `num_axes` value is greater than 0, and if true, it evaluates another condition that involves the size of the data and the number of axes.
2. The fix adds an extra check to make sure that `num_axes` is less than 8 in addition to being greater than 0.
3. The fix also checks that the size is greater than `num_axes * (sizeof(hb_tag_t) + sizeof(int))`, which ensures that there is enough data to process the axes.
4. If all the conditions pass, the code iterates over the axes, extracting the `tag` and `value`, and then calls `hb_subset_input_pin_axis_location` function to set the axis location.
5. Finally, the fix also removes duplicate code by declaring `input` outside the second `if` condition block.
