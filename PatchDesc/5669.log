Vulnerability:
The vulnerability patched in this diff file is a potential buffer overflow in the `DecodeImage` function. The vulnerability occurs when the `bytes_per_line` is less than 8, and the pixels are already uncompressed. In this case, the function does not check if the number of pixels (`number_pixels`) to be copied from the `scanline` buffer exceeds the allocated memory for `pixels`, which can lead to a buffer overflow and potential crash or arbitrary code execution.

Summary of Fix:
The fix in this patch is to add a check to ensure that the number of pixels (`number_pixels`) to be copied from the `scanline` buffer does not exceed the allocated memory for `pixels`, thereby preventing a potential buffer overflow.

Detailed Description of Fix:
In the `DecodeImage` function, after the check for `bytes_per_line < 8`, the fix starts by adding the following code:
```c
if ((q+number_pixels) > (pixels+(*extent))) {
  (void) ThrowMagickException(exception,GetMagickModule(),
    CorruptImageError,"UnableToUncompressImage","`%s'",
    image->filename);
  break;
}
```
This code checks if the destination pointer `q` plus the number of pixels to be copied, exceeds the allocated memory for `pixels`. If it does, it throws a `CorruptImageError` exception and breaks out of the loop, preventing the buffer overflow.

Additionally, a similar check is added in the subsequent `for` loop to avoid potential buffer overflows when `scanline_length` is greater than or equal to `row_bytes`:
```c
if (scanline_length >= row_bytes) {
  (void) ThrowMagickException(exception,GetMagickModule(),
    CorruptImageError,"UnableToUncompressImage","`%s'",image->filename);
  break;
}
```
This check ensures that the `scanline_length`, which represents the length of the scanline buffer, is less than `row_bytes`, which represents the allocated memory for a single row of pixels. If `scanline_length` is greater than or equal to `row_bytes`, it throws a `CorruptImageError` exception and breaks out of the loop to prevent a potential buffer overflow.

Overall, these checks ensure that the number of pixels to be copied from the `scanline` buffer does not exceed the allocated memory for `pixels`, preventing a buffer overflow vulnerability.
