Vulnerability:

The vulnerability addressed in this diff file is a missing call to the function "SetImageBackgroundColor(image,exception)" in the function "ReadPALMImage". This missing call could lead to uninitialized memory being used when setting the background color of the image.

Summary of the fix:

The fix involves adding the missing call to "SetImageBackgroundColor(image,exception)" in the "ReadPALMImage" function.

Detailed description of the fix:

To fix the vulnerability, the following changes were made:

1. Added the missing call to "SetImageBackgroundColor(image,exception)" just after the line that sets the image extent.

```
+ (void) SetImageBackgroundColor(image,exception);
  status=SetImageExtent(image,image->columns,image->rows,exception);
```

This ensures that the background color of the image is properly set before further processing.

By adding this call, the background color of the image will be set before any other operations are performed on the image. This prevents the usage of uninitialized memory and ensures that the background color is properly set.

This fix ensures that the image is loaded correctly without any uninitialized memory being accessed.
