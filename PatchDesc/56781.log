Vulnerability: The vulnerability that this fix addresses is an invalid argument passed to a function `LOG_FUNC_RETURN`.

Summary of the Fix: The fix adds a check to ensure that the length of the `path` is at least 2 before executing further code. If the length is less than 2, it returns with an error code `SC_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENTS`.

Detailed Description of the Fix: In the given code, the `cosm_delete_file` function starts by selecting the parent DF (Directory File) using the `sc_select_file` function. Before calling `sc_select_file`, the code modifies the `path` object by decreasing its length by 2 (`path.len -= 2`). The decreased length is then used to retrieve the parent DF.

The fix includes the addition of a check after updating the `path` object. It checks if the length of the `path` is less than 2 (`if (path.len < 2)`). If the length is indeed less than 2, the code returns with an error code `SC_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENTS`.

This fix prevents potential issues that may arise from using an invalid `path` length. By ensuring a minimum length of 2, the code avoids any unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities caused by passing an invalid `path` to subsequent functions.
