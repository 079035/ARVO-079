Vulnerability: Use of uninitialized value in GetFillAlpha()

Summary of the fix:
The fix for this vulnerability eliminates the use of an uninitialized value in the GetFillAlpha() function.

Detailed description of the fix:
Previously, there was a variable `beta` that was used without being initialized in the GetFillAlpha() function. This could lead to undefined behavior and potential security issues. In the fixed code, the variable `beta` is initialized to 0.0 before it is used for computations. This ensures that the variable has a defined value before any operations are performed on it. This fix eliminates the use of uninitialized values and ensures the correctness of the calculations in the GetFillAlpha() function.
