Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is that the cue sheet parsing code skips the first second (S) when parsing cuepoints in the format MM:SS.SS. This leads to incorrect parsing of cuepoints, where "00:12.34" would be parsed as "00:02.34".

Fix Summary:
The fix for this vulnerability involves removing the line that skips the ":" character after parsing the minutes field.

Detailed Fix Description:
In the original code, after parsing the minutes field, the code skips the ":" character. This is not intended behavior and results in the vulnerability. Removing this line will ensure that the full cuepoint string is processed correctly.

To fix the vulnerability, the following line should be removed from the code:

```c
s++; /* skip the ':' */
```

After applying the fix, the code will correctly parse the cuepoints in the format MM:SS.SS without skipping any characters.
