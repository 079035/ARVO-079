Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code is that it contains assembly comments using the "#" symbol, which is causing an error on openSUSE Leap 15.2 when running the code. Specifically, the line "clang-debug-names-debug.S:72: Error: junk at end of line, first unrecognized character is `#'".

Summary of Fix:
The fix for this issue is to replace the "#" symbol with the "/* ... */" comment style in the assembly comments.

Detailed Description of Fix:
The fix involves modifying the file "gdb/testsuite/gdb.dwarf2/clang-debug-names.exp.tcl" and replacing the "#" symbols with the "/* ... */" comment style. The line that needs to be modified is:

"  .short 5                      # Header: version"

It should be modified to:

"  .short 5                     /* Header: version */"

This change ensures that the assembly comments in the code use the correct comment style and resolves the error caused by the "#" symbol. The sed command is used in the commit message to make this change automatically. The fix has been tested on both aarch64-linux and x86_64-linux platforms.
