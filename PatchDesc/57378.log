Vulnerability Description:
In the given diff file, the vulnerability being patched is a null dereference in the function `xsltKeyFunction`. This is identified by OSS-Fuzz and reported as issue #84.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix for the vulnerability involves checking if the `ret` variable is `NULL` before accessing its members in the `xsltKeyFunction` function. If `ret` is `NULL`, the function sets the error code `XPATH_MEMORY_ERROR` and frees the objects `obj1` and `obj2` before returning.

Detailed Fix Description:
In the `xsltKeyFunction` function, after checking the types of `obj2`, a new `xmlXPathObjectPtr` called `ret` is created as an empty `xmlXPathNodeSet`. Before using `ret`, the fix checks if it is `NULL` and, if so, sets the error code `XPATH_MEMORY_ERROR`. Additionally, the objects `obj1` and `obj2` are freed before returning.

The fix ensures that if `ret` fails to be allocated properly due to memory limitations, the error code `XPATH_MEMORY_ERROR` is set and memory is cleaned up to avoid further issues.

This fix prevents the null dereference vulnerability by properly handling allocation failures and ensuring that the error code is set accordingly.
