Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that has been patched in this diff file is a use of uninitialized value in the `ParseGeometry()` function.

Summary of the fix:
The fix eliminates the use of uninitialized values in the `ParseGeometry()` function.

Detailed description of the fix:
The fix initializes the variable `flags` and the `geometry_info` structure to zero at the beginning of the `ParseGeometry()` function. This ensures that all flags and values are properly initialized, preventing the use of uninitialized values later in the code.

Additionally, the fix removes unnecessary whitespace characters from the `geometry` string by copying the sanitized string to a new variable `pedantic_geometry`.

The fix then uses a loop and switch statement to process each character in the `pedantic_geometry` string. Based on the character, the relevant flag is set appropriately. This ensures that all flags are correctly assigned.

The fix also includes various checks and parsing logic to extract values for rho, sigma, xi, psi, and chi from the `geometry` string. The extracted values are then assigned to the corresponding fields in the `geometry_info` structure.

The fix also handles special cases and normalizes certain values, such as normalizing sampling factors.

Overall, the fix ensures that all values and flags are properly initialized and assigned, eliminating the use of uninitialized values in the `ParseGeometry()` function.
