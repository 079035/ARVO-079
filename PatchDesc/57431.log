Vulnerability:
The vulnerability patched in this diff file is the inclusion of sensitive files (`xpath.xml` and `seed`) in the `EXTRA_DIST` variable of the Makefile. These files were being distributed along with the project's source code.

Summary of Fix:
The fix removes `xpath.xml` and `seed` from the `EXTRA_DIST` variable of the Makefile, preventing them from being included in the distribution of the project.

Detailed Description of Fix:
1. In the diff file, the line `EXTRA_DIST = xpath.dict xpath.xml xslt.dict seed` is replaced with `EXTRA_DIST = xpath.dict xslt.dict`. This change removes the references to `xpath.xml` and `seed` files from the `EXTRA_DIST` variable.

Impact:
Removing the inclusion of sensitive files (`xpath.xml` and `seed`) in the distribution of the project reduces the potential exposure of the project's sensitive information to unauthorized users. This helps in maintaining the security and integrity of the codebase.
