Vulnerability:
An uninitialized string is being used to initialize a std::string variable. This could result in undefined behavior as the data may not be null-terminated.

Summary of Fix:
The fix ensures that the std::string is initialized correctly by providing the size of the data being used.

Detailed Description of Fix:
In the original code, the std::string variable 'color' is being initialized using the reinterpret_cast of the 'Data' pointer. However, this does not guarantee that the data is null-terminated, which can cause issues.

To fix this, the fix modifies the initialization of the 'color' string by providing the size of the data as the second argument to the std::string constructor. This ensures that only the necessary amount of data is used to initialize the string, preventing any potential issues with null-termination.

The modified code looks like this:

```
std::string color(reinterpret_cast<const char*>(Data), Size);
```

Now, the 'color' string is properly initialized with the correct size, ensuring that it contains only the valid data received, without relying on null-termination. This fixes the vulnerability and ensures the code behaves as intended.
