Vulnerability:
There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `_bfd_ecoff_slurp_symbolic_info` function in the `bfd/ecoff.c` file.

Summary of the fix:
The fix involves zero terminating the string sections in the `debug` structure.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the given diff file, the fix involves adding the following lines of code:

```
+  /* Ensure string sections are zero terminated.  */
+  if (debug->ss)
+    debug->ss[internal_symhdr->issMax - 1] = 0;
+  if (debug->ssext)
+    debug->ssext[internal_symhdr->issExtMax - 1] = 0;
```

These lines of code ensure that the string sections `ss` and `ssext` are properly zero terminated. This prevents buffer overflows that could occur if the string sections were not properly terminated.
