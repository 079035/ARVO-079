1. Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code was related to the allocation of the bitstream buffer size. The original size of 256000 did not account for the worst-case FGC SEI payload size. This could potentially lead to buffer overflow issues if the payload size in conjunction with other NALU's sizes exceeded the default bitstream buffer size.

2. Short Summary of the Fix:
The fix involves adjusting the bitstream buffer size to account for the worst-case FGC SEI payload size. The new buffer size is set to the sum of the original size (256000) and the maximum FGC SEI size.

3. Detailed Description of the Fix:
In the updated code, a new constant `MAX_FGC_SEI_SIZE` is defined, which represents the worst-case size of the FGC SEI payload. This size is calculated based on the worst-case bits for all elements before 'num_intensity_intervals_minus1', 'film_grain_characteristics_repetition_period', and the elements from the previous line. The `MIN_BITSTREAMS_BUF_SIZE` is then updated to be the sum of `MAX_FGC_SEI_SIZE` and the original buffer size (256000). This ensures that the buffer size is large enough to handle the worst-case scenario, thus preventing potential buffer overflow issues.
