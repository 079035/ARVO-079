1. Summary of the fix:
The fix in the diff file addresses a vulnerability related to parsing geometry specifications in the `MagickCore/geometry.c` file.

2. Description of the vulnerability:
In the `ParseGeometry()` function, the code does not properly handle certain characters in the geometry string. This can lead to incorrect parsing of the geometry values and potential memory corruption.

3. Description of the fix:
The fix in the diff file includes several changes to the `ParseGeometry()` function to address the vulnerability:

- The code now removes whitespace and certain meta characters from the geometry string before parsing.
- The code checks for valid characters and handles them correctly, including special cases like coordinates and negative offsets.
- The code normalizes sampling factors and supports negative height values.
- The code now correctly handles percentage values and sets them to the nearest integer size.
- The code includes additional error handling and reporting.

These changes improve the robustness and correctness of the geometry parsing logic, addressing the vulnerability and ensuring that geometry specifications are parsed correctly.
