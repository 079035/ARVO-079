1. Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the original code was an integer overflow vulnerability. This could occur when calculating the `desc_start` and `size` variables in the `GetBuildId` function. The overflow could happen when adding `nhdr->n_namesz` and `align` or `nhdr->n_descsz` and `align`. If an overflow occurred, it could lead to incorrect calculations and potentially allow for memory corruption or other unexpected behavior.

2. Short Summary of the Fix:
The fix improves the overflow check in arithmetic addition. It checks that the computation of `desc_start` and `size` don't overflow, and then checks that `size` is not too large. This is done by adding additional conditions in the if statement that checks for potential overflows.

3. Detailed Description of the Fix:
The fix modifies the if statement that checks for potential overflows. In the original code, the if statement checked if `nhdr->n_namesz` or `nhdr->n_descsz` were greater than or equal to `-align`, or if `size` was less than `sizeof(*nhdr)`, or if `note + size` was greater than `last`. 

In the fixed code, the if statement checks if `desc_start` is less than `sizeof(*nhdr)`, or if `size` is less than `desc_start`, or if `size` is greater than `last - note`. This ensures that the computation of `desc_start` and `size` don't overflow and that `size` is not too large. 

Additionally, the comment "Beware of overflows / wrap-around." was changed to "Beware of wrap-around." to reflect the changes made in the code. 

A new test case was also added to the `profile_builder_fuzz` directory to test this fix.
