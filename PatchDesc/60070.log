Vulnerability:
Heap Buffer Overflow

Summary of the fix:
The fix addresses a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the `thrift.c` file.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the original code, the function `thrift_set_method` copies the `method` string into the `flow->protos.thrift.method` buffer using the `strncpy` function. However, the size of the `method` string may exceed the size of the destination buffer, resulting in a buffer overflow.

To fix the vulnerability, the code has been modified to use `ndpi_min` to determine the maximum number of characters to copy from the `method` string. This ensures that the copy operation does not exceed the size of the destination buffer, preventing a heap buffer overflow.
