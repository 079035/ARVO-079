Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is a potential out-of-bounds read and a possible memory allocation error. This vulnerability could lead to a crash or potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Summary of Fix:
The fix for this vulnerability involves adding null checks before accessing the memory, as well as modifying the memory allocation to avoid potential memory allocation errors.

Detailed Description of Fix:
1. Null Check:
   - Before accessing the memory, a null check is added to ensure that the memory is not accessed if it is null. This prevents out-of-bounds reads and potential crashes.

2. Memory Allocation:
   - The code checks if the allocated memory is null after resizing or acquiring memory. If the memory allocation fails, a fatal error is thrown, preventing potential memory allocation errors.

3. Normalize Spaces:
   - The fix also involves adding a check for the end of the string. After normalizing spaces for non-CDATA attributes, the code checks if the end of the string has been reached. If it has, the loop is broken to prevent potential out-of-bounds reads.

Overall, the fix adds error handling and bounds checking to prevent crashes and memory allocation errors.
