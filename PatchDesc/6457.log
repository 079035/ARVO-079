Vulnerability:

The vulnerability in the given diff file is a memory leak. In the function `WritePCDImage`, if the condition `if (image->columns < image->rows)` is true, the image is rotated and assigned to `rotate_image`. However, after rotating the image, the original `rotate_image` is not destroyed, resulting in a memory leak.

Summary of the fix:

The fix for this vulnerability is to destroy the `rotate_image` after rotating it, and assign the blob of the original image to the rotated image.

Detailed description of the fix:

1. After rotating the image, add the following line to destroy the `rotate_image`:

```c
DestroyImage(rotate_image);
```

2. Assign the blob of the original image to the rotated image by replacing the following line:

```c
pcd_image=rotate_image;
```

with:

```c
pcd_image=rotate_image; 
pcd_image->blob=ReferenceBlob(image->blob);
```

These changes ensure that the rotated image is properly destroyed to avoid memory leaks, and the blob reference is updated to the original image's blob.
