Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is that the z arrays are not properly initialized within the functions bigint_cnd_add and bigint_cnd_sub in the mp_core.cpp file. This leads to potential uninitialized memory usage.

Summary of the fix:
The fix initializes the z arrays with zeroes before using them in the functions bigint_cnd_add and bigint_cnd_sub.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. In the function bigint_cnd_add:
   - The line `word z[8];` is removed.
   - The line `word z[8] = { 0 };` is added to initialize the z array with zeroes.

2. In the function bigint_cnd_sub:
   - The line `word z[8];` is removed.
   - The line `word z[8] = { 0 };` is added to initialize the z array with zeroes.

By initializing the z arrays with zeroes before using them, the fix ensures that there is no uninitialized memory usage in the functions. This helps address the vulnerability reported by OSS-Fuzz.
