Vulnerability: 
The vulnerability in this code exists in the `ReadMACImage` function. The code does not properly handle errors when allocating memory for the `pixels` array. If the memory allocation fails, the function continues execution and attempts to use the `pixels` array without checking if it is valid. This can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or other issues.

Summary of the fix:
The fix adds a check after the memory allocation for the `pixels` array to verify if the allocation was successful. If not, the function returns and frees any previously allocated memory.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. After the memory allocation for the `pixels` array, a check is added to verify if the allocation was successful:
```c
pixels=(unsigned char *) AcquireQuantumMemory(length+1,sizeof(*pixels));
if (pixels == (unsigned char *) NULL) 
    ThrowReaderException(ResourceLimitError,"MemoryAllocationFailed");
```
2. If the allocation failed, the function returns and frees any previously allocated memory:
```c
if (pixels == (unsigned char *) NULL) 
{
    if (image != NULL)
        image=DestroyImageList(image);
    return((Image *) NULL);
}
```
This ensures that the code does not continue execution with an invalid `pixels` array.
