Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given diff file is that the function `GetQuantumRange` does not handle a depth value of 0 correctly.

Summary of the fix:
The fix adds a special case in the `GetQuantumRange` function to handle a depth value of 0.

Detailed description of the fix:
The fix adds an if statement at the beginning of the `GetQuantumRange` function to check if the depth value is 0. If it is, then the function immediately returns 0. This ensures that the function handles the special case of a depth value of 0 correctly.

By returning 0 for a depth value of 0, the function avoids potential issues that could arise from performing bitwise shifting operations and calculation of a value in the subsequent code.

The fix guarantees that when the depth value is 0, the correct value of 0 is returned by the function, preventing any unintended behavior or incorrect calculations that could result from trying to shift or mask a value with an invalid depth value.
