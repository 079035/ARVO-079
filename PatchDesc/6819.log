Vulnerability: Improper memory allocation leading to a heap buffer overflow.
This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

Summary of Fix: The fix for this vulnerability is to properly allocate memory for the "pixels" array to prevent a heap buffer overflow.

Detailed Description of Fix:
In the function `ReadPDBImage`, the `pixels` array is allocated using the `AcquireQuantumMemory` function. However, the size of memory allocated is not correctly calculated, leading to a potential heap buffer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the code has been modified as follows:

```diff
 size_t
    bits_per_pixel,
    num_pad_bytes,
    one,
    packets;
  
  ssize_t
    count,
    img_offset,
    comment_offset = 0,
    y;
 
  unsigned char
    *pixels;
 
  /*
  ...
  */
  
+  num_pad_bytes = (size_t) (img_offset - TellBlob(image));
+  while (num_pad_bytes-- != 0)
+  {
+    int
+      c;
+ 
+    c = ReadBlobByte(image);
+    if (c == EOF)
+      break;
+  }
+  /*
+    Read image header.
+  */
+  count = ReadBlob(image, sizeof(pdb_image.name), (unsigned char *) pdb_image.name);
+  if (count != sizeof(pdb_image.name))
+    ThrowReaderException(CorruptImageError,"ImproperImageHeader");

  pdb_image.version = ReadBlobByte(image);
  pdb_image.type = (unsigned char) (ReadBlobByte(image));
  pdb_image.reserved_1 = ReadBlobMSBLong(image);
  pdb_image.note = ReadBlobMSBLong(image);
  pdb_image.x_last = (short) ReadBlobMSBShort(image);
  pdb_image.y_last = (short) ReadBlobMSBShort(image);
  pdb_image.reserved_2 = ReadBlobMSBLong(image);
  pdb_image.x_anchor = ReadBlobMSBShort(image);
  pdb_image.y_anchor = ReadBlobMSBShort(image);
  pdb_image.width = (short) ReadBlobMSBShort(image);
  pdb_image.height = (short) ReadBlobMSBShort(image);

  /*
  ...
  */

  // Allocate memory for the pixels array
-  packets=(bits_per_pixel*image->columns+7)/8;
-  pixels=(unsigned char *) AcquireQuantumMemory(packets+257UL,image->rows*
-    sizeof(*pixels));
+  packets = (bits_per_pixel * image->columns + 7) / 8;
+  pixels = (unsigned char *) AcquireQuantumMemory(packets * image->rows,
+    sizeof(*pixels));
  if (pixels == (unsigned char *) NULL)
-    ThrowReaderException(ResourceLimitError,"MemoryAllocationFailed");
+  {
+    (void) CloseBlob(image);
+    return(DestroyImageList(image));
+  }
  
  (void) ResetMagickMemory(pixels, 0, packets * image->rows * sizeof(*pixels));
  
  switch (pdb_image.version & 0x07) 
  {
    case
