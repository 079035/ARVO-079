Vulnerability:
In the file "MagickCore/draw.c", there is a vulnerability related to the function "DrawDashPolygon". At line 1432, there is a buffer overflow vulnerability where memory is allocated using AcquireQuantumMemory based on the length of "primitive_info" and is assigned to "dash_polygon". However, the length is calculated incorrectly, which leads to an insufficient allocation of memory.

Summary of Fix:
The fix for this vulnerability is to increase the length calculation for "dash_polygon" by 1, due to the addition of the terminating element "UndefinedPrimitive" that was previously not considered.

Detailed Description of Fix:
Prior to the fix, the length calculation of "dash_polygon" is incorrect and does not account for the extra element required to terminate the "dash_polygon" array. This inconsistency causes insufficient memory allocation and leads to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

The fix increases the length calculation by 1, using the formula `(2UL*(number_vertices+2UL)+1UL)`. This accounts for the additional element "UndefinedPrimitive" needed to properly terminate the "dash_polygon" array.

Now, when memory is allocated using AcquireQuantumMemory with the correct length, the buffer overflow vulnerability is resolved.
