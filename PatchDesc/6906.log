Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that could be patched in this diff file is the failure to check that slice widths are positive in the `Cr2Decompressor::decode()` function.

Summary of the fix:
The fix adds a loop to iterate through each `slicesWidth` value in the `slicesWidths` vector and check if it is less than or equal to 0. If a negative or zero value is found, an exception is thrown with the error message "Bad slice width: %i".

Detailed description of the fix:
The fix modifies the `Cr2Decompressor::decode()` function by adding the following lines of code before calling `AbstractLJpegDecompressor::decode()`:
```cpp
for (auto slicesWidth : slicesWidths) {
  if (slicesWidth <= 0)
    ThrowRDE("Bad slice width: %i", slicesWidth);
}
```
In this loop, each `slicesWidth` value in the `slicesWidths` vector is checked. If a negative or zero value is found, the function `ThrowRDE()` is called, passing the error message "Bad slice width: %i" and the value of `slicesWidth` as arguments. This exception indicates that an invalid slice width has been encountered.

This fix ensures that all slice widths passed to the `Cr2Decompressor::decode()` function are strictly positive, preventing any further processing or potential issues caused by negative or zero values.
