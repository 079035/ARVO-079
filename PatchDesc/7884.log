Vulnerability: 
The vulnerability in the code is related to the handling of the IFD (Image File Directory) decryption in the ArwDecoder::GetWB() function. The code mistakenly allocates the entire size of the original IFD buffer instead of allocating only the required size. This leads to uninitialized garbage at the end of the buffer.

Summary of the fix:
The fix involves making two modifications:
1. Allocate memory for the new buffer only for off+len bytes instead of the entire size of the original IFD buffer. This ensures that only the required portion is decoded and avoids uninitialized garbage at the end.
2. Prevent the IFD from pointing to the uninitialized garbage in the buffer by adding a check in the decryption process.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. Instead of allocating the entire size of the original IFD buffer, the fix creates a new buffer named DecryptedBuffer using the off and len values.
   - The line `const auto EncryptedBuffer = ifd_crypt.getSubView(off, len);` creates a subview of the original IFD buffer starting from off and with a length of len.
   - The line `const auto DecryptedBufferSize = off + EncryptedBuffer.getSize();` calculates the size required for the decrypted buffer by adding the off value and the size of the encrypted buffer.
   - The line `auto DecryptedBuffer = Buffer::Create(DecryptedBufferSize);` creates the decrypted buffer of the calculated size.

2. The fix also adds a check to prevent the decrypted root IFD from pointing to the preceding padding buffer (uninitialized garbage). This is done by creating a new buffer named Padding containing the subview of the decrypted buffer starting from position 0 with a length of off.
   - The line `const Buffer Padding(decIFD.getSubView(0, off));` creates a subview of the decrypted buffer starting from position 0 with a length of off.
   - The line `ifds_decoded.emplace(Padding);` adds the padding buffer to the set of decoded IFDs, ensuring that the decrypted root IFD does not point to the padding buffer.

By making these modifications, the fix resolves the vulnerability by correctly handling the IFD decryption and avoiding uninitialized garbage.
