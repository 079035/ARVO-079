Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the provided diff file is that the function `strcpy_url` does not ensure that values less than `0x80` are not URL-encoded. This can lead to incorrect URL encoding for characters that do not need to be encoded, which can cause issues with IDN resolution.

Summary of the fix:
The fix for this vulnerability is to change the condition in the `if` statement from `*iptr >= 0x80` to `!ISPRINT(*iptr)`. This ensures that only non-printable characters are URL-encoded.

Detailed description of the fix:
In the `strcpy_url` function, the code checks if the current character is less than `0x80` to determine whether it needs to be URL-encoded. However, this condition is incorrect, as characters less than `0x80` can still be printable and should not be URL-encoded.

The fix replaces the condition `*iptr >= 0x80` with `!ISPRINT(*iptr)`. The `ISPRINT` macro checks if a character is printable or not based on the ASCII character set. This ensures that only non-printable characters are URL-encoded.

With this fix, the `strcpy_url` function will correctly URL-encode only non-printable characters, while leaving printable characters as they are. This helps prevent issues with IDN resolution and ensures correct URL encoding.
