Vulnerability:
The vulnerability that was patched in this diff file is an unchecked router id when allocating a router in the `RouterTable::Allocate` function.

Summary of fix:
The fix involves adding a validation check for the router id before allocating the router. The router id is now checked to ensure it is less than or equal to the maximum router id (`Mle::kMaxRouterId`). If the router id is invalid, the allocation is skipped.

Detailed description of fix:
In the original code, the function `RouterTable::Allocate` did not have any validation checks for the router id before allocating the router. The fix added the validation check by modifying the condition in the `VerifyOrExit` macro.

The fix verifies three conditions before allocating the router:
1. The router id is less than or equal to the maximum router id (`Mle::kMaxRouterId`).
2. The router id is not already allocated.
3. The router id has no reuse delay.

If any of these conditions fail, the function will exit without allocating the router.

The addition of the validation check prevents allocating routers with invalid router ids, which could lead to undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities.
