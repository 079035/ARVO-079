Vulnerability: Shift value is assigned to the wrong operand in the printT2AddrModeSoRegOperand() function in the ARMInstPrinter.c file.

Summary of the fix: The fix for this vulnerability is to correctly assign the shift value to the operand.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. In the original code, the shift value is assigned to the operand at index `MI->flat_insn->detail->arm.op_count - 1`, which is incorrect.
2. In the fix, the shift value is assigned to the operand at index `MI->flat_insn->detail->arm.op_count`, which is the correct operand.
3. This ensures that the shift value is associated with the correct operand and avoids any potential incorrect behavior.
4. By making this fix, the shift value will be correctly printed and stored in the instruction details, providing accurate information about the ARM instruction.
