Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code could be that the code does not handle a specific case where the `TagSize` is less than 8. This can lead to an error or unexpected behavior when reading the tag.

Summary of the fix:
The fix ensures that if the `TagSize` is less than 8, the code handles it as an error and goes to the `Error` label.

Detailed description of the fix:
1. First, the fix adds a check `if (TagSize < 8) goto Error;` to ensure that the `TagSize` is greater than or equal to 8.
2. If the `TagSize` is less than 8, it means that there is corrupted data or an error. Thus, the code goes to the `Error` label to handle this situation.
3. This fix helps prevent potential buffer overflows or other undefined behavior that could occur when reading a tag with a size less than 8.
