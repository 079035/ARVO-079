Vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the given code patch is that the length (variable `len`) is not rounded down to a multiple of 4 before being used in the SonyDecrypt() function. This can lead to accessing memory beyond its bounds if the length is not already a multiple of 4.

Summary of the Fix:
The fix in the code patch is to round down the length (`len`) to a multiple of 4 before using it in the SonyDecrypt() function. The comment added states that the decryption is done in blocks of 4 bytes.

Detailed Description of the Fix:
1. The line `uint32 len = roundDown(sony_length->getU32(), 4);` is added to round down the length to a multiple of 4.
2. This ensures that only the correct number of bytes (a multiple of 4) is passed to the SonyDecrypt() function.
3. By rounding down the length to a multiple of 4, the fix prevents accessing memory beyond its bounds and eliminates the possibility of a buffer overflow vulnerability.
4. The decryption is performed on the rounded down length in blocks of 4 bytes, ensuring that it is aligned correctly and processed efficiently.
5. The fix improves the security and stability of the code by handling the encrypted data correctly and reducing the risk of memory corruption or undefined behavior.
