    I made an aggressive abort of the pdf14 device when the page rendering
    had failed. This is not the correct thing to do as the page rendering could
    have failed for a number of non-transparency issues.
    
    Overnight tests had such an issue, which caused a seg fault.  see
    https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=704820
    
    The pdf14 aborts need to occur further up stream.  I will do some additional
    testing to see that various group push and pop failures are handled properly
    and add the needed device abort.
