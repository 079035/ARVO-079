Subject: [PATCH] Set doc on element obtained from freeElems

In commit 8c9daf79, a call to xmlFreeNode was added in
xmlSAX2StartElementNs. If a node was obtained from the freeElems list,
make sure to set the doc, otherwise xmlFreeNode wouldn't realize that
the node name might be in the dictionary, causing an invalid free.

Note that the issue fixed in commit 8c9daf79 requires commit 0ed6addb
and this one to work properly.
