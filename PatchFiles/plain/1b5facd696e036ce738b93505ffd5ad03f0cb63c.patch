    GhostPDF - bound check the W array values in an XRefStrm
    
    OSS-fuzz #54436
    
    The PDF file had been fuzzed so that one of the W entries was negative,
    which is not valid. This later caused problems when we tried to read
    that number of bytes (cast to unsigned) from a file into a buffer which
    was sized based on the signed value. That caused a buffer overrun and
    subsequent crash.
