    Ghostscript - clean up exec stack on error sampling functions
    
    OSS-fuzz #55898
    
    When sampling a PostScript function, if the supplied function consumes
    more operands from the operand stack than were present, then we throw
    an error, attempt to unwind the stack and exit.
    
    However, we weren't cleaning up the execution stack. This could
    eventually lead to us trying to execute the completion routine stored
    there, which would fail badly.
    
    This commit just tidies up the execution stack, removing the objects we
    no longer need when returning an error.
