Subject: [PATCH] AK: Utf8CodePointIterator: Don't output full string to debug
 output

When a code point is invalid, the full string was outputted to the debug
output. For large strings, this can make the system quite slow.
Furthermore, one of the cases incorrectly assumed the data to be null
terminated. This patch modifies the debug statements not to print the
full string.

This fixes oss-fuzz issue 35050.
