    OSS-fuzz #43268.pdf - beware of repair rebuilding xref
    
    The file is broken (of course) and causes a repair during the course
    of reading an object form the file while dereferencing an indirect
    reference.
    
    The repair causes the xref table to be discarded and rebuilt, and that
    causes the reference to the xref entry to become invalid. Simply update
    the reference after reading an object to ensure it is up to date.
