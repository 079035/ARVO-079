Subject: [PATCH] flow: Fix buffer overread for crafted IPv6 packets.

The ipv6_sanity_check() function implemented a check for IPv6 payload
length wrong: ip6_plen is the payload length but this function checked
whether it was longer than the total length of IPv6 header plus payload.
This meant that a packet with a crafted ip6_plen could result in a buffer
overread of up to the length of an IPv6 header (40 bytes).

The kernel datapath flow extraction code does not obviously have a similar
problem.
