Subject: [PATCH] ptimize: move the definition of extrajmps to the block in
 which it's used.

That makes it a bit clearer than it's not used outside that block;
compilers and static analyzers can determine that, but this makes it
easier for human analyzers to see that, and thus that it can neveer be
bigger than 2.
