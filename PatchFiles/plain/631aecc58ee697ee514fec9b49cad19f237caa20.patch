    OSS-fuzz #49290
    
    The problem here is an (I think) corrupted TrueType font. One of the
    glyphs claims to be a component glyph, and the component GID is
    larger than the number of glyphs in the font (and so is invalid).
    
    When we copy the font (which we only do with pdfwrite and ps2write) we
    try to copy this glyph which is not otherwise used in the document.
    As part of trying to copy the glyph we try to get the glyph name for
    both the glyph and the components of the glyph.
    
    Normally we walk the font twice, putting the glyph names for each
    glyph into the name table on the first pass, and then retrieving them
    on the second. Because the component glyph is not valid, we (obviously)
    don't find it on the first pass, and don't add it to the name table.
    
    On the second pass we use the glyph ID to try and get the name, but
    because we didn't store it on the first pass there is no such name with
    that ID, so we get an empty slot back. Which we don't check! We then
    try to use it which involves dereferencing a NULL pointer, and we
    crash.
    
    This commit checks the GID of the component glyphs and makes sure they
    are in the valid range so that (hopefully) this can't happen.
    
    This also checks the name returned from name_index_ref to ensure it is
    not an unused name slot, to avoid a crash if we find another route
    that fails to return a name. We use this a lot in many places and
    it's not obvious which ones are guaranteed safe and which might not be
    so I haven't tried to change the other cases.
