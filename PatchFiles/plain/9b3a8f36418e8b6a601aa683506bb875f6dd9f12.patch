Subject: [PATCH] jcapimin.c: Revert changes made in fc01f467

Those changes worked around an innocuous UBSan warning that was
exposed by the new TurboJPEG 3 transform fuzz target, due to the fact
that tj3Transform() no longer rejects images with unknown subsampling
configurations.  That UBSan warning was a false positive, and attempting
to fix it introduced a buffer overrun triggered by a malformed input
image that causes jpeg_write_marker() to be called with datalen == 0.  I
suspect that the UBSan false positive was only reproducible on my local
machine, but I guess we'll see.
