Subject: [PATCH] rdppm.c: Fix innocuous MSan error

A fuzzing test case that was effectively a 1-pixel PGM file with a
maximum value of 1 and an actual value of 8 caused an uninitialized
member of the rescale[] array to be accessed in get_gray_rgb_row() or
get_gray_cmyk_row().  Since, for performance reasons, those functions do
not perform bounds checking on the PPM values, we need to ensure that
unused members of the rescale[] array are initialized.
