    OSS-fuzz #49606
    
    If we rejected an addition to the xref table because the object number
    exceeds a 32-bit signed integer, less than 0, or the generation number
    is less than 0 or the file offset is less than 0 we were not returning
    an error (earlier incarnations of the code didn't expect it to).
    
    But when decoding an object stream if we didn't get an error code we
    would assume the object was present in the xref table and try to use
    the xref  entry.
    
    Fix that by returning an error code if we didn't add an entry to the
    xref table.
