Subject: [PATCH] TFM Read Radix 16 OOB Read Change the location of the update
 of the write index when in fp_read_radix_16(). It will do multiple writes
 into a word, and update the index when the word is full and there is more to
 write. If there isn't more to write, the index isn't incremented. This
 ensures the used value in the mp_digit is correct, and not off-by-one when
 the last word is full.
