# Last two weeks
- Tested the idea of "using ASAN results to locate the vulnerable variable"
  - ASAN mainly focuses on overflow vulnerabilities.
  - We can locate the variable but can't locate the option
  - It's hard to tell if it's just off-by-one or overflow since the provided input is just one case that can trigger the crash. 
  - Also, ASAN maps 8 bytes to 8 bits. So if there is only one byte of redzone is changed, we can't decide the type of vulnerability
  - But we can get the variable's name and type
    - What can we do with this?
    - In testing, the information "StackOverflow/Heapoverflow" can't help Codex much. I guess that's because Codex is fixing source code so it doesn't care about if it's on stack or heap.
    - The variable name is useful cause Codex could know "what to change" from this information
    - But in testing, I found it hard to use this information. [For example, 31585]
- Statistics(I manually analysis about 30 random vulnerabilities)
  - Most vulnerabilities are not easy to fix (for Codex(manually) and humans)
  - But most of them only change a few (<=3) source files
  - I am writing code to generate statistics
- Biggest Issue
  - Hard to get enough vulnerability information to help codex fix it.
  - Bug fixing is related to implicit information and context analysis
